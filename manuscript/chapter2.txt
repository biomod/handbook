# Before Starting Your Project

## Subject Matter of Project

It may be difficult to choose a topic for your project. In addition to accommodating different intersts of the team members, you will have to learn about designing biomolecules. Below are some important points to consider when choosing a project.

### What Do You Want to Do? Setting Priorities

BIOMOD is not an ordinary competition in which participants compete for a single, defined goal. That is, you can choose your own goal as well as your methods of reaching it. Anything goes as long as the subject matter of the project relates to "designing biomolecules". In such an open-ended project, having team consensus is important. Teams should have a solid consensus about the group’s activities.

Your team should agree as to how to prioritize these considerations:

- Something no one has tried
- Applicability and practicality
- Is it of interest to other people
- Showy staging
- Importance of technical execution of project

### Brainstorming

Once these priorities have been agreed on, you can start to narrow down the specifics of the project. It can be any project that relates to the designing of biomolecules. You may not exactly know what it is like to design a biomolecule, so you should consult this book, YouTube videos of previous participants, and discuss the question with upper-class students and teachers. Then you need to discuss your possible ideas with other team members to generate more ideas and refine the ideas that come up--brainstorming. There are different types of brainstorming (see section: Types of Brainstorming).

### Turn Tough Times into Opportunities

Sometimes brainstorming may not bring new ideas and you may be caught in a circle of fruitless discussion. However, this is really an opportunity for you to generate good ideas. Brainstorm over several sessions until, after days of discussion, you think you have investigated as many things as possible but in vain, and you can come up with no more ideas. At this point, consult the mentors. They will give you some good hints.

### A Good Idea Has Clear Logic

What is a good idea, and how can you judge whether an idea is a good one. A good idea needs to be logical. "Logical" means:

1. The team’s priority is clear.
2. The question is in line with that priority.
3. The process to solve that question is fairly clear.

You should be able to summarize these three points clearly and simply. For example, a good idea might be summarized as:

1. The subject matter must be universal.
2. Let's make a tool that is applicable to a wide variety of situations.
3. This should be feasible by combining/developing tools from previously reported studies.

However, the last one might be difficult for you to judge. Again, you can consult the mentors.

### Turning an Idea into a Topic

An idea with clear logic is relatively easy to turn into a project. Next, you should make a list of prerequisites:

- What will be required to complete the project ?
- Are there methods available to demonstrate (experiment  with) it?
- Are the necessary materials available?
- Is the experimental equipment available?
- Do we enough bandwidth? Enough time?

### Keep in Mind the System for Judging the BIOMOD Competition

You should design your project with an aim to win, not just participate. At BIOMOD, all projects are scored by judges. Judges are selected from the mentors of participating teams, who are professionals in this field. You have to satisfy these people to get a high score, regardless of how confident you are in your project. Check the judging criteria of BIOMOD as you design your project (see section 3).

This competition is good practice for getting grants, where your work is also evaluated by others. Evaluations depend on the value system of the community of researchers, and of academic and human society.

### Rise and Fall of a Project

Once you have chosen a topic, the project starts. You don't have much time until the final (see section 6). However, sometimes you may have to change topics. If you have enough team members, you can run more than one project in parallel and then narrow the list down to a single project that seems promising. In the course of the experiment, however, you may encounter an obstacle that you cannot overcome, in which case you may have to reconsider the subject matter itself. In that case, you should construct the overall logic of a new topic all over again. The judges and the audience will only see the final presentation. Changing topics midstream is difficult, but sometimes necessary. In the process of reconsideration, the logic is polished and becomes clearer. The victory will be yours after you get through it.

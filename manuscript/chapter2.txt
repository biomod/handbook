# Before Starting Your Project

## Subject Matter of Project

It may be difficult to choose a topic for your project. In addition to accommodating different intersts of the team members, you will have to learn about designing biomolecules. Below are some important points to consider when choosing a project.

### What Do You Want to Do? Setting Priorities

BIOMOD is not an ordinary competition in which participants compete for a single, defined goal. That is, you can choose your own goal as well as your methods of reaching it. Anything goes as long as the subject matter of the project relates to "designing biomolecules". In such an open-ended project, having team consensus is important. Teams should have a solid consensus about the group’s activities.

Your team should agree as to how to prioritize these considerations:

- Something no one has tried
- Applicability and practicality
- Is it of interest to other people
- Showy staging
- Importance of technical execution of project

### Brainstorming

Once these priorities have been agreed on, you can start to narrow down the specifics of the project. It can be any project that relates to the designing of biomolecules. You may not exactly know what it is like to design a biomolecule, so you should consult this book, YouTube videos of previous participants, and discuss the question with upper-class students and teachers. Then you need to discuss your possible ideas with other team members to generate more ideas and refine the ideas that come up--brainstorming. There are different types of brainstorming (see section: Types of Brainstorming).

### Turn Tough Times into Opportunities

Sometimes brainstorming may not bring new ideas and you may be caught in a circle of fruitless discussion. However, this is really an opportunity for you to generate good ideas. Brainstorm over several sessions until, after days of discussion, you think you have investigated as many things as possible but in vain, and you can come up with no more ideas. At this point, consult the mentors. They will give you some good hints.

### A Good Idea Has Clear Logic

What is a good idea, and how can you judge whether an idea is a good one. A good idea needs to be logical. "Logical" means:

1. The team’s priority is clear.
2. The question is in line with that priority.
3. The process to solve that question is fairly clear.

You should be able to summarize these three points clearly and simply. For example, a good idea might be summarized as:

1. The subject matter must be universal.
2. Let's make a tool that is applicable to a wide variety of situations.
3. This should be feasible by combining/developing tools from previously reported studies.

However, the last one might be difficult for you to judge. Again, you can consult the mentors.

### Turning an Idea into a Topic

An idea with clear logic is relatively easy to turn into a project. Next, you should make a list of prerequisites:

- What will be required to complete the project ?
- Are there methods available to demonstrate (experiment  with) it?
- Are the necessary materials available?
- Is the experimental equipment available?
- Do we enough bandwidth? Enough time?

### Keep in Mind the System for Judging the BIOMOD Competition

You should design your project with an aim to win, not just participate. At BIOMOD, all projects are scored by judges. Judges are selected from the mentors of participating teams, who are professionals in this field. You have to satisfy these people to get a high score, regardless of how confident you are in your project. Check the judging criteria of BIOMOD as you design your project (see section 3).

This competition is good practice for getting grants, where your work is also evaluated by others. Evaluations depend on the value system of the community of researchers, and of academic and human society.

### Rise and Fall of a Project

Once you have chosen a topic, the project starts. You don't have much time until the final (see section 6). However, sometimes you may have to change topics. If you have enough team members, you can run more than one project in parallel and then narrow the list down to a single project that seems promising. In the course of the experiment, however, you may encounter an obstacle that you cannot overcome, in which case you may have to reconsider the subject matter itself. In that case, you should construct the overall logic of a new topic all over again. The judges and the audience will only see the final presentation. Changing topics midstream is difficult, but sometimes necessary. In the process of reconsideration, the logic is polished and becomes clearer. The victory will be yours after you get through it.

## Types of Brainstorming

Four eyes see more than two. Generating ideas in a group setting can be far more productive than  individuals trying to generate ideas on their own. Brainstorming should be done in a divergent, free-flowing manner [1]. This section introduces brainstorming and other techniques to generate ideas in a group setting.

### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a techniques to find new ideas and perspectives through divergent thinking. More than one member gathers to have a free, extensive discussion on a given subject matter. It is the most orthodox process for generating creative ideas, and can be conducted in a very straightforward manner.

First, decide together on a concrete topic. For example, the subject matter "how to make every worker wear a hard hat" is better than "how to reduce construction site accidents". Then, individual members write ideas relating to the subject matter on a large sheet of paper or whiteboard, and all discuss them one by one. The number of members and the length of the whole process are not particularly limited, but several to 10 members and about 1 hour work well. If you want go it for  longer, the group should take a break about every 1 hour to refresh yourselves.

In brainstorming, you can present essentially any idea but you should note the following four points:

1. Welcome wild ideas: Free yourself from common sense and good sense to present any idea. Never mind if it is strange or unusual.
2. Withhold criticism: Evaluation of proposed ideas should be put on hold. Do not criticize other members' ideas or your own, however ridiculous or uninteresting they seem.
3. Go for quantity: Instead of looking for the finest ideas, present as many ideas as possible.
4. Combine and improve ideas: Active utilization of existing ideas is also important. Modifying and combining different ideas can effectively generate new advanced ideas. As described in (2), do not criticize ideas of others unless it improves the ideas and as a consequence generates new ideas.

### How to Generate Ideas

It is up to you how to generate ideas. Below are some tips on generating ideas.

1. Free association: this includes association by contrast, association by contiguity, and association by similarity.
- Example of association by contrast: "day <-> night", "female <-> male"
- Example of association by contiguity: "sea <-> beach", "car <-> road"
- Example of association by similarity: "ball <-> earth", "bird <-> airplane"
2. Nonrandom association: this includes "forced association" and "analogy". Forced association is a technique to impose some condition on the subject matter, and then generate ideas. Analogy is a technique to get inspiration from something that is essentially analogous to the subject matter.
- Example of forced association: Choose "novel scissors" as the subject matter. Impose a condition such as "they are to be transformed", " they are for seniors", etc.
- Example of analogy: Choose "novel scissors" as the subject matter. Think "The role of scissors is to cut" -> "Cutting is the purpose of guillotines, too" -> "Let's make novel scissors based on guillotines".
3. Different perspectives: Think about different "products", "properties", "functions", "combinations", and so on, from "bird's eye view/bug's eye view" or the like [2].

### Brainwriting

"Brainwriting" is similar to brainstorming [3]. It is effective in generating many ideas in a short time, generating ideas in a group of rather reticent people, etc. Below is an example of the process, applied to six people.
1. Participants sit in a circle or square.
1. Prepare six worksheets, each with 6 rows and 3 columns.
1. Distribute the worksheets to the participants, one sheet per participant. Write the subject matter at the top of the worksheet.
1. Generate 3 ideas that relate to the subject matter and write them in the 3 blanks in the first row, within 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Then, pass on your worksheet to the neighbor on your left and receive another worksheet from your neighbor.
1. Look at the ideas in the first row in the worksheet that was passed to you, and write 3 new ideas in the 3 blanks in the second row. Again, pass on the worksheet in the same pattern--to the left.  7) Every time you receive a worksheet, add new ideas inspired by the ideas in it (you can develop ideas of the previous participant or propose totally different ideas inspired by them).
Repeat the steps 6 times in total. This takes 30 minutes or less, and you will get as many as 108 ideas (= 6 members x 3 ideas x 6 rounds).

### Mind Map

In this technique, a list of ideas inspired by the subject matter is generated by drawing pictures.  Draw the subject matter in the center of a blank page.
  2) Write ideas inspired by the subject matter around it, and connect the subject matter and each idea with a line.
  3) Add new ideas inspired by each written idea. Connect each of the former ideas and the latter with a line.
  You can make use of curves, colored pencils, or something to make it more fun and visually interesting. This idea generation technique can be used in an individual setting.

### KJ Method

The 3 techniques described above are for divergent idea generation. Sometimes you may have to sort the ideas generated. One technique to sort ideas is the KJ method [4], which can be summarized as follows.

1. Record ideas on cards (or notes). One idea per card.
1. Sort the cards into groups based on the content, and give a representative title to each group.
1. Sort the groups into larger clusters based on the title, and give a representative title to each cluster. Repeat this step.
In the course of this process, the divergent list of ideas gains become s organized by theme.

# Chapter 6 Software Techniques

## 53. Basic Software Programs: Overview

Because "design" of a biomolecule, the subject matter of the BIOMOD competition, is invisible to the naked eye, you must demonstrate the results of your project in a readily understandable manner. Your scores, therefore, are based on your Wiki, YouTube, and presentation. Your documents, tables, graphs, and presentation slides, including animations and videos, should be high quality and effective.

### Office Suite

You can use Microsoft Office to prepare all your materials (see section 3). Microsoft Office is an office suite (a collection of business software) provided by Microsoft; the regular suite contains Word (document preparation), Excel (spreadsheet), and PowerPoint (presentation). Another example of an office suite is iWork, provided by Apple Inc., which includes Pages, Numbers, and Keynote.

### Necessity of Different Software Applications

However, without exception, previous winners of BIOMOD Project Award Gold (see section 5) employed not only an office suite like Microsoft Office but also other diverse applications to prepare their Project Website,  YouTube Video, and Presentations. This is because "intuitively understandable", "persuasive", and "enjoyable" contents have to include images, videos, and 2D/3D animations, and dedicated software works better to produce these materials.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig01.png)

#### To Make Images Impressive

The graphic tools in PowerPoint allow you to not only draw figures but to adjust the brightness, contrast, and tone of an image. However, using Illustrator (graphic design software) and Photoshop (photo editor), provided by Adobe, will improve the visual elements of your materials (the illustration below was drawn on Photoshop). While these two programs are payware, there are free applications that will also work, such as Inkscape and GIMP.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig02.png)

(See section 56)

#### To Make 3D Images Intuitively Understandable

3D images are often necessary to make your Wiki, YouTube, and presentations easier to understand. There are a wide variety of 3D CGI applications, but all of them involve modeling, material, animation, and lettering, which are described below.

#### To Make Images More Persuasive

Image-J is a popular processing/analysis application for creating image data from wet experiments. In spite of being free and open-source, it performs well and has advanced functions that can even satisfy professional researchers. It supports a variety of file formats ranging from TIFF, PNG, JPEG, BMP, AVI, and other basic ones, to uncommon formats. You should master it as a powerful tool not only for use in BIOMOD but also for your graduation thesis, master’s thesis, and other researches (see section 58).

![](images/ch6/ch6fig03.png)

#### To Make a Video Enjoyable to Watch

According to the judging criteria in previous BIOMOD competitions, the YouTube video is 25% (see section 3) of your score. Thus, video making skills are key. The commercial software Premiere Pro and the freeware programs such as Windows Movie Maker and AviUtl are introduced below.

## 54. Document/Table/Graph Preparation

This section introduces Gnuplot for graphing.

### Document Preparation

When your project starts, you will discuss the schedule and roadmap (a chart that lists tasks necessary to achieve your goals in a timeline) with other team members. In the course of the project, you will go through many meetings to discuss the design specification, the status of each member's task, and so on (see section 7). You should make full use of document preparation software such as Word to make the group work more efficient and effective. In business settings, meeting documents and proceedings are often prepared in Word and electronically distributed. Similarly, you should make use of document preparation software as a tool for efficient group work.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig05.png)

### Spreadsheet

Many of you have probably used Microsoft Excel, a program that creates spreadsheets. For BIOMOD, Excel can help manage data management/analysis, and can also output results as tables and various graphs.

For data management, its "Data" menu provides Sort, Filter (data extraction), Remove Duplicates, Subtotal, PivotTable, and other basic functions which allow the import of external data sources. It can also help the management of your group work. For example, if the project is divided among the team members, you can create a table of the tasks of individual members, share the Excel file on the web, and have each member update the status of her/his task in the table, to see the overall status of the project at a glance. Like Word, just one spreadsheet can be a powerful tool to dramatically improve the efficiency of your group work when combined with IT.

In relation to data analysis, the use of various Excel functions allows basic statistical analyses, e.g. mean and variance, and more complex statistical analyses, e.g. test of a difference between population means, nonparametric test, correlation, and multivariate analysis. There are many textbooks on the use of Excel in statistical analysis and multivariate analysis. For examples, see reference \[1\].

If you want to combine Excel functions to perform complex calculations/tasks efficiently (a series of tasks automatically), it can be greatly facilitated by "macro" ("Tool"-"Macros" in the menu). You can write a macro using the programming language VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for Excel. Interested readers are referred to reference \[2\] and other guides.

Last but not least, tables and graphs can be easily created by selecting "Insert"-"Table", "Graph" in the menu. Particularly, you can choose an appropriate graph from column, line, pie, bar, area, scatter, and other charts (stock, contour, doughnut, bubble, and radar) depending on your purpose, which is an advantage of using the graph drawing tool of Excel.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig06.png)

### Graph Drawing

You should also learn the software Gnuplot, which allows for efficient graph drawing. This free, open-source software program with advanced functions can be regarded as a programming language for 2D/3D graph drawing. Excel is more convenient in that it allows you to make a graph by just following a wizard, but Gnuplot provides more functions and performs better at processing a large amount of data quickly into a graph.

{aside}
**Column: TeX**

Undergraduates science majors often write their graduation thesis on TeX. Scientific papers in some field are also often written in TeX (needless to say, many are Microsoft Word users). TeX is a free typesetting system, wherein the users prepare texts and images/tables (i.e. contents), while the computer takes care of layout and other non-content elements of the document based on class file (or style file) and other settings. Writing in TeX is rather like making a webpage in the HTML language, and thus more cumbersome than writing in Word. Nevertheless, many people are still using TeX all over the world, possibly because it can make equations particularly beautiful.

## 55. Preparation of Presentation Slides

In BIOMOD, most of you will use PowerPoint to make a presentation. This section introduces points, tips, and taboos in the use of PowerPoint to prepare slides.

### Presentation

As already discussed in section 10, a presentation at BIOMOD is different from a typical conference presentation, in that you can add drama and entertainment to it. But the most important thing is to make the content of your project understood, and to explain it clearly.

Presentation structure (example):

 1. Title, team name, and affiliations
 2. Background
 3. Goal of the project
 4. Details of the design and its operating principles
 5. Experimental/simulation results
 6. Conclusions
 7. Future prospects and discussion

#### Presentation Structure

In a presentation, simply showing the results of your project is not enough. You need to emphasize the points of your story and pace the talk effectively. For that purpose, the structure of the presentation should also take the psychology of the audience into account. If your experiment has been successful, then show it at the climax. If your experiment has not been successful but has prompted a unique principle, place more emphasis on its description. In addition, arrange the results in the best order to make them understood.

In any kind of presentation, the goals and conclusions should agree with each other. If they don't, the audience may not believe your argument. In addition, you can also strongly impress the audience by talking about the future progress that can result from your results.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig07.png)

Dos and Don'ts in Preparing Slides

There are a number of textbooks on general presentation techniques and PowerPoint. You should read at least some of them if you are involved in these tasks. Shown below are the most basic points.

Good Slides:

- Title of each slide summarizes its point.
- Texts and figures are clear and easy to understand.
- Provides necessary and sufficient information.
- An appropriate proportion of time/space is allotted to each piece of information depending on its importance.
- Sufficiently understood even in the absence of the words of the speaker.
- Text is consistent with the speaker's words.
- All slides have a consistent format.

Bad Slides:

- The focus is unclear.
- Texts and images are too small to read.
- An important point is written in a small font.
- An elaborate figure is used to describe a less important thing.
- Terms used in the slides differ from those in the speaker's words.
- Different slides have different formats.


Appoint a Director to Standardize Slides:

The slide work, probably done during one week after the Wiki deadlines of the domestic trial and the final, should be divided among all of the team members. An appointed director should standardize all the slides in terms of font, text size, coloring, icon, and many other things.

Time Allocation:

Read the speech script to time the presentation on a stopwatch. Adjust the number of slides and the length of script for each part so that you can allocate enough time to the most important points.

Synchronization between the speech script and the slides:

Terms used in the script have to completely match those in the slides. In addition, the flow of the script for a slide must match the order of things displayed in that slide (from the top to the bottom, from the left to the right).

Simple and clear slides:

Each slide should not contain too much information. Texts should be in a large font and brief. In general, one slide should not contain more than 7 lines.

Use of consistent terms and icons:

Each thing should have one name, one icon, and one shape of the same coloring throughout the slides. Since your group all are working, some of you might be using different names for the same things. You need to make sure these are changed to reflect the same terminology. This is where communication among the team members matters.

Graph Requires Text Summary:

A look at each slide should tell the viewer approximately what it means. Make sure each graph of your results has text that summarizes what your graph indicates.

Last Slide:

This slide will be on the screen throughout the discussion time, and thus should include more than something like "Thank you for your attention", such as a summary of the results or a positive message.

Movie and Visual Effects:

Unfortunately, a movie embedded in a slide sometimes fails to play at the BIOMOD final. Instead, you should rely on animation wherever you can. Do not abuse visual effects during slide change. Save them for where they are really needed.

Appoint a Slide Flipper:

Let the speaker concentrate on reciting the speech script, by appointing someone else to switch the slides. The slide switcher should rehearse again and again in advance to learn where to change slides in the script.

## 56. Figure Preparation

Graphic information is an important means of aiding understanding. Effective figures will greatly improve the impression of your Wiki, YouTube, and presentation. If you want to prepare higher-grade figures, you should master Illustrator (representative graphic software) and Photoshop (photo editor).

### Two Ways to Prepare a Figure

Many of you probably have already used some graphic software or paint tool to draw figures. Windows "Paint" is one of the most popular paint tools. There are two kinds of image drawing software, one that uses raster images and one that uses vector images. If you want to prepare higher-grade figures, you should know what the difference is between them and how to choose a software program(s) appropriate for your purpose. In the figure below, the letter on the left, which is composed of "pixels", is called a raster image. The letter on the right, which is composed of "coordinates and lines", is called a vector image.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig09.png)

### Raster Images are Drawn with Pixels

A raster image is also called bitmap image. Each image is made of the information on the color (tone) of pixels. In the case of a raster image of 640 x 480 pixels, the entire color (tone) information of the 307,200 pixels can be directly written in an image file, which will have the extension "BMP". Alternatively, the information can be compressed into an image file of a smaller size, which will have an extension such as JPG and PNG. Windows "Paint" is a representative raster image drawing software program. Photographs taken with a digital still camera are all raster images (guess why if you are familiar with cameras). A raster image is apt to have a large file size and has the disadvantage that its edges become rough when magnified.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig10.png)

### Vector Images are Drawn with "Paths" and "Fills"

The information of a vector image is basically provided by draw commands (see the right image in the following figure). You can draw it solely based on the information of the coordinates of the start points and the end points and the nature of the line segments between them (commands). When draw commands for a vector image are outputted as an image file, it will have an extension such as AI, PDF, and SVG. A vector image has a smaller file size than its raster image counterpart, and maintains smooth edges when magnified. For example, in a vector image, a 10-fold increase in its width will not roughen the edges because the only difference is something like the use of the command "Draw a line from the point (0, 0) to the point (100, 0)" in place of the command "Draw a line from the point (0, 0) to the point (10, 0)".

![](images/ch6/ch6fig11.png)

Even if an image is drawn based on draw commands, it is not practical for you to input the draw commands like a program. What you need is a software program that allows drawing actions of the user to be performed intuitively, and automatically converts them into draw commands.

#### Illustrator: A Software Program for Vector Image Drawing

In a software program for vector image drawing, its "user-friendliness" is more important than in a raster image drawing program,. The graphic software Illustrator (Adobe) is a representative software program for the former \[1\].

To master Illustrator, you should learn about the terms anchor point, segment, and path (see the figure below for an example). (1) Selecting the Pen tool and (2) clicking on the start point will create an anchor point there. Then (3) clicking on the end point will create another anchor point there and a segment (a straight line in this case) will appear between these two points. To continue the drawing, (4) clicking on another point will create the next anchor point, which will add another segment. An uninterrupted line composed of anchor points and a segment(s) is called a path. If Illustrator is new to you, you should start from the Pen tool and proceed to adding a new anchor between segments, connecting anchors with a smooth curve, and then drawing a more complex curve.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig12.png){width="4.2711122047244094in" height="3.48125in"}

#### Inkscape: Free Vector Drawing Software

Illustrator is a high-performance software program that can provide a collection of advanced functions such as those demanded by professional designers, but you have to pay for it. Fortunately, there is the freeware Inkscape \[2\]. It has basic functions comparable to those of Illustrator, and will be a powerful tool for you to prepare higher-quality figures.

#### Photoshop: A Software Program for Raster Image Drawing

Apart from various vector images, photographs taken with camera are a kind of raster image. Therefore, you will also need a software program to add effects to a photograph or adjust its contrast, brightness, and tone. Among such raster images, photographs and other complex images are usually processed with a specific kind of software, which is called a photo editor. Photoshop (Adobe) is a photo editor \[3\]. You can also scan a free-hand drawing and process it with Photoshop to have a digital illustration as follows.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig13.png)

Alternatively, you can use GIMP, a freeware program with basic functions comparable to those of Photoshop.

## 57. 3D Animation

Animation can be very effective in explaining molecular reactions and mechanisms. However, creating an animation requires as many as thousands of images and thus enormous labor. However, you can create it relatively easily with the help of three-dimensional computer graphics (3D CGI).

### Modeling

First, this section describes the implementation of a moving model (modeling) for animation. In 3D CGI, a human character or any other object is composed of vertices, edges, and faces, which is called a polygon. There are three modeling methodologies: polygonal modeling, which directly edits a polygon, curved surface modeling, which indirectly edits a polygon using Bezier and NURBS curves, and sculpt modeling, which creates an object like clay working. Polygonal modeling is the most basic, whereas curved surface modeling is suitable for symmetric structures such as cylinders and sculpt modeling is good for making complex structures with many bumps. Increasing the number of polygons (high poly) means you can model a more complex structure, but this also requires more of your PC.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig14.png)

### Material

You can change the color, material, and reflectivity of your model by changing material settings. Texture settings are used to add surface patterns, smaller features, and other details. A texture that carries color and similar patterns is called a color texture, and a texture with the information on features drawn on it is called a normal map texture. Although these textures can be created using a graphics editor, they can be downloaded from the CG Textures site and other similar websites, too. To use a texture, a process of projecting the texture onto your model (UV mapping) is required.

![UV mapping](images/ch6/ch6fig15.png)

### Animation

In 3D CGI animation, a motion is made by registering a pose of a model for each time point and interpolating the poses. An animation made by registering the poses, or "setting key frames", is called a key frame animation. You can use Graph Editor to perform the motion interpolation in detail. To move a human, animal, or any other multi-jointed model, bones (a skeleton) are used. Each bone is subjected to "skinning" to associate it with the polygon of the model, which allows a move of the bones to change the morphology of the polygon. Bones (a skeleton) have a hierarchical structure: a structure in which a child follows the motion of its parent is called FK (forward kinematics), and a structure in which the motion of a child determines the position of its parent is called IK (inverse kinematics). In the motion of bones of hands, legs, and other object-contacting parts, IK is usually employed. Although FK provides a higher degree of freedom of motion, the use of IK in walking, pushing an object, and similar motions can improve your animation. An animation is usually created by hand drawing, but it is also possible by motion capture to generate the motion of a CG model from that of a real person or object, or by baking physical computing results to key frames. Using these techniques, you can create an animation that is too complex to input by hand.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig16.png)

Model (left) and skeleton (right).

![](images/ch6/ch6fig17.png)

Key frame animation.

### Rendering

In rendering, a light source(s) is set to illuminate a model and an image is created based on the lighting and camera settings. The overall quality of your animation is greatly affected by the settings of rendering. Lighting usually includes key light, fill light, and back light ("three-point lighting"). In rendering, you can use ray tracing to add reflection and refraction by tracing the path of a light to reach the camera, global illumination to compute lights reflected on an object (indirect light), ambient occlusion to add 3d appearance by shading gaps and hollows in the model, and other functions to obtain high-quality graphics comparable to live action films.

2D animation and similar graphics can also be rendered by emphasizing the edges of a model, binarizing the shades, and other techniques (cel shading).

![](images/ch6/ch6fig18.png)

### Closing Remarks

The above are just a taste of 3D CGI creation. You can also render a fluid, the destruction of an object, and so on by employing physical computing, Boolean, and other functions. Commonly, it is more practical to reduce the rendering time required for retake by outputting the background and the model in your movie separately. Output them as numbered images that support transparency (e.g. in a PNG format), which will be combined later using a video editor. This can also be applied to combining them with a real background.

## 58. Image Processing

There are two kinds of graphics for BIOMOD, namely figures and raw images for data extraction. This section outlines the process to extract data from an experimentally obtained image. You should try to obtain high-quality data by processing a digital image in a highly reproducible manner using reliable software.

### What is Image Processing?

Image processing extracts any desired information from a given image. The world's earliest drawing may be the wall paintings at Lascaux Cave, which include a line drawing of a colored bison. At present, most images are digital data, any of which you can copy easily and perfectly and treat as a set of pixels (dots), each with a discrete brightness, on a computer. You can not only enjoy their patterns and colors but also quantify data contained therein (e.g., length, brightness distribution, particle size distribution, and complexity of closed curve). The process is outlined below.

### Different Types of Images

As a result of a given experiment, you will often obtain a digital image from electrophoresis, microscopy (optical, fluorescence, atomic force, and electron), or the like.

There are essentially two kinds of graphics for BIOMOD: figures and raw images for data extraction. An image for data extraction can be processed into a figure, but not vice versa. Note that good data comes from a good image.

There are a variety of formats digitized image data can take, and popular ones have an extension like .JPG, .PNG, .TIFF, or .BMP. In addition, each software program may have its own format. Uncompressed TIFF format is the de facto standard for images for data processing.

### Pre-processing is Critical

In a thriller TV or movie, you may have seen a blurred face of a suspect getting sharpened through image processing. However, image processing does not always go like that. Of course, you can use macros to automate data processing. Extraction from an image with too much noise will be very difficult to do. There are a variety of noise reduction algorithms (for example, a Gaussian filter, a median filter, or a two-dimensional Fourier transform, a window function, and then an inverse Fourier transform \[\*\]).　It is the job of the experimenter who has actually obtained an image from an experiment to process the image into an automatically analyzable state for data extraction.

### Examples of Image Processing

Image-J is one of the most popular image-processing freeware programs in the field of science and technology \[1\]. Free, useful macros have been developed and published by its users all over the world.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig19.png)

ImageJ, in spite of its somewhat antique UI, is compatible with the latest OSs. Below is an exemplary process of particle analysis using it.

Original image -&gt; store in a TIFF format -&gt; import into ImageJ: file information is provided at the top left, such as 800 x 600 pixels; RGB; 1.8 MB.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig20.png)

Scaling: for example, draw a line over the 20 μm scale bar by hand, and select Analyze -&gt; SetScale to display Distance in pixels: 45 -&gt; then enter Known distance: 20 and Unit of Length: μm.

Binarization: Process -&gt; Binary -&gt; Make Binary. Then confirm that you see black particles on a white background. Otherwise, invert it by Select All -&gt; Edit -&gt; Invert.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig21.png)

Particle analysis: Analyse -&gt; Analyse Particles -&gt; input counter conditions (see below for an example) -&gt; OK

![](images/ch6/ch6fig22.png)

to start counting.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig23.png)

This example includes 27 particles, with the area of each particle displayed. It can be outputted into Excel.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig24.png)

Instead of ImageJ, you can also use the Adobe Photoshop and the freeware GIMP \[4\]. For scientific purposes, ImageJ and its wide range of macros will suffice. See reference \[5\] for details and sections 56, 57, and 59 for CG/image preparation.

### Universal Rules

Quality requirements may differ depending on your purpose, but will usually include no debris (only the original experimenter can decide if something in an image is truly debris), good contrast, less noise, good size of the object in the image, high resolution, and good tone levels. Always try to obtain a good image that facilitates image processing.

## 59. Video Editing

In BIOMOD, each team is required to make a Youtube video, which is worth up to 25 points. There is no single best way to make it. This section introduces some software-based editing techniques, referring to videos of previous participants.

### Overview

Once you have set the policy on how to make your video and have the scenario and casts set (see section 9), you actually start making the video. In general, video editing proceeds by collecting movie, audio, and other data, editing and adding effects to them, and then setting the timeline. As the video is nearing completion, show it to other team members and get feedback to revise it again and again. Usually, these different steps need different software programs.

Necessary data include movies, sounds, BGM, and subtitles. The movies are prepared by CG (see section 57) or live action. The TITECH team 2011 won second place in the Youtube category with a movie that combined PowerPoint animation and live action. The Tohoku University team 2012 won first place on the Youtube Award with a movie that combined live action and CG. You may also add complex effects to your movie using the software program After Effects \[1\] or the like.

You can record sounds and BGM, or you can use found materials. Sound editors are not discussed here. The Arizona State University team 2014 won second place for Youtube Award using melodies that they composed. In addition to these examples, you should refer to other highly evaluated videos in previous BIOMOD competitions (see section 5).

### Video Editing

When it comes time to do the video editing, you will further process the collected movie and audio data, copy and paste them, and arrange them in place. There are various applications that can assist in these processes, and you can choose the one you like. An exemplary commercial application is Premiere Pro \[2\], while Windows Movie Maker \[3\] and AviUtl \[4\] are freeware. Their execution screens are shown in FIG. 1.

![Execution screen of Premiere Pro, Windows Movie Maker, and AviUtl](images/ch6/ch6fig25.png)

In any of these software programs, timeline editing is a central part of the task. Timeline specifies the timing of shots, sounds, effects, and subtitles. As an example, FIG. 2 shows a timeline of about 10 seconds on AviUtl, made by the Tohoku University team in 2012.

The timeline proceeds to the right. Vertically, layers are stacked that specify materials used for each time point. Blue indicates a picture, including subtitle. Red indicates a sound or BGM, and green indicates an effect at a scene change.

As seen from the above, each scene of the video will be made by combining multiple types of information, where your editing skills matter. Do it carefully, referring to the preview window.

![Aviutl timeline](images/ch6/ch6fig26.png)

### Output and Upload of Video

Once the timeline is complete, then you can encode it to output as a video. Encoding is very complicated and not discussed in detail here. In principle, you will refer to Youtube settings \[5\] to perform encoding using a software program. As specified by the link, you should care about resolution, aspect ratio, frame rate, bit rate, container format, and codec. Play the resulting video and go through every scene to see if there is any problem, e.g. distorted picture, sound too large, or sound too small. Note that the encoding can take a long time.

After the video is complete, you can upload it to Youtube. You can use the annotation function of Youtube to embed a link in the video. A link to the website of your team (see section 8) will be effective.

## 60. Numerical Analysis Library

Scilab is a freely available, beginner-friendly, high-level programming language for numerical analysis, visualization, signal processing, and data analysis. It is a powerful tool you can use for BIOMOD for experimental data analysis and numerical simulation.

C Language is Versatile but not Always the Best

For numerical calculation or for data analysis, homework, or a graduation thesis, you can use C language to write a program(s) sufficient for that purpose. The greatest advantage of C language is its execution speed; it can quickly process even a large-scale numerical calculation with the help of memory allocation and pointers. C language has can do a lot of things, but is not the best choice for every calculation. Typical cases are shown below.

### Case 1: Calculation of the eigenvalues of a matrix

You have to learn linear algebra and code an algorithm to calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix of n rows x n columns. Therefore, debugging will also take a considerable amount of time. Alternatively, you have to find a matrix calculation library for C language, install it, and use call functions in the library from your source code. Of course, the library must be reliable (one you have happened to find on the Internet will not be safe to use in various senses).

Typical Case in BIOMOD

In BIOMOD, you will often have to numerically simulate a DNA reaction to validate its operating principles and examine experimental data.

### Case 2: Simulation of the time course of DNA concentration

This involves two problems for a programmer to solve: i.e., "numerical solution to the initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation" and "visualization of the results". For the numerical solution, you will have to find a numerical integration library, which is similar to the Case 1 situation. For the visualization, a convenient method is to output a file of simulation results, import the file into Excel, Gnuplot, or the like (see section 54), and draw a graph. However, there an easier method.

### Scilab

Scilab can do numerical analysis, visualization, signal processing, and data analysis, and has the following features:

**Freeware**

This is particularly important in BIOMOD. You can download it from the Scilab website \[1\] and install it on your personal computer. It works with Linux, Mac, and Windows. There are a number of Japanese textbooks on it.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig27.png)

**Provided with a large numerical analysis library**

This frees programmers from the problem of how to get a numerical analysis library. You only have to install Scilab to get numerical analysis functions (solvers) for linear algebra, numerical integration, data analysis, signal analysis, and so on. That is, all you have to do is learn "how to use each function". For example, in Case 1, define a matrix A and then use spec(A), which will return the eigenvalues of the matrix A. In Case 2, use the numerical integration function code.

**Easily creates 2D/3D graphs**

This means that, like Gnuplot (see section 54), Scilab has advanced graph drawing functions that allow beautiful 2D/3D graphics.

![](images/ch6/ch6fig28.png)

Scilab is a programming language that allows you to carry out a series of tasks such as data import, numerical analysis, and graph drawing in a seamless manner, has a grammar easier to understand than that of C language, and does not require programmers to worry about data type and memory allocation (students in my laboratory mastered its use for basic operations in a few days).

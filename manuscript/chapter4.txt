# Chapter 4 Basic Textbook Knowledge

## 36. Importance of Multidisciplinary Knowledge: Overview

To win BIOMOD, you have to educate yourself in molecular chemistry/physics, programming, mechanical engineering, biology, and computer science. You can also organize a multidisciplinary team with students from other departments to invent a biomolecular system of great originality that can surprise the world.

### Designing Molecular Systems

In BIOMOD, the word design has a somewhat different meaning from its conventional meaning, which is "design of a molecule". In the field of chemistry, to design a molecule means "designing a chemical structure with desired physical properties, based on the notion that each molecule has distinct physical properties that depend on its chemical structure". In BIOMOD, the meaning of the word focuses on the programmability of DNA. DNA molecules with different sequences are different from each other in chemical structure, but virtually the same in their physical properties and ability to hybridize to complementary sequences. In other words, the base sequence of a DNA molecule, rather than its physical properties, determines its interaction partner and the strength of the interaction. By carefully combining a large amount of mutually complementary sequences, you can construct a reaction system that behaves entirely in a programmed fashion; i.e. you can "design the behavior of a system made of multiple molecules". What kind of knowledge is required to design such a molecular system?

### Structural DNA Nanotechnology

"DNA nanotechnology" is the field of research that investigates the programmability of DNA. Initially, DNA nanaotech focused on the use of sequence-specific hybridization of DNA to assemble nanostructures \[1\]. Such study has recently been termed "structural DNA nanotechnology", which began with the finding by the chemist Seeman that a DNA molecule can create crossovers with two or more other DNA molecules that are partially complementary to it. This prompted computer scientists to systematically design DNA sequences, resulting in the development of DNA origami and other related techniques (see section 18). In addition, we can think of such systematic self-assembly of molecules as an information-processing step. We can use these investigations to develop new computation models that are different from electronic computing ones.

### Dynamic DNA Nanotechnology

You, too, can assemble a DNA nanomachine, which is a DNA nanostructure capable of mechanical motion (see section 24). This technique is based on the strand displacement reaction of DNA, identified by the physicist Yurke and colleagues \[2\]. The use of this reaction to build logic gates has been extensively studied (see section 29). These reactions are generically called "dynamical DNA nanotechnology". To design such a dynamic system, you need to understand thermodynamics. This chapter discusses some of relevant thermodynamic theories. We predict that, in the near future, research measuring the force generated by nanomachines will become important; understanding some mechanical engineering will be key in this field of study. In this field of mechanics you may have to learn about molecules, solution systems, and other soft materials, as well as the so-called "four mechanics" (mechanics of materials, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and dynamics of machinery), because the dimensions and principles of molecular nanomachines are totally different from those that dictate the working of conventional macro-scale mechatronics.

### DNA Computing

In computer science, the field of research to develop novel computation models inspired by natural phenomena is called "natural computing". "DNA computing" started when the computer scientist Adleman, the inventor of the RSA cipher, solved a traveling salesman problem using DNA reactions (see section 35)\[3\]. After having succeeded in assembling DNA nanostructures (structural DNA nanotechnology) and moving them (dynamical DNA nanotechnology), scientists are aiming at constructing intelligent molecular systems (molecular robotics). In BIOMOD, you don't have to limit your project to DNA nanostructures. Try to exploit the potential of biomolecules as much as possible to design an elaborate system that may not exist, or is not yet known, in natural biological systems.

### Transdisciplinary Team

As described above, successful BIOMOD projects require a transdisciplinary team. Because DNA and protein are biological macromolecules, you need knowledge in chemistry and macromolecular physics to experiment with and analyze them in depth. If you want to design a molecular robot, you will need some knowledge in mechanical engineering and programming. If you are familiar with electronics, you might be able to develop a novel measurement technique. In addition, a broad range of knowledge in biology, medicine, and computer science will help you identify an exciting project. However, it is impossible to learn all these things in such a short period, which is why you need a diverse team. Team members must communicate to support each other and work in an organized manner, putting the right people in the right places. Last but not least, most Japanese students seem to have some trouble with their English skills. Do not forget to give yourself language education, so you can work worldwide as a researcher or engineer.

## 37. Thermodynamics

This section introduces internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and other concepts that are required to understand the thermodynamic properties of DNA.

### Basic Concepts: System and Surroundings

The universe is divided into two parts: a system and its surroundings. A system is what can be analyzed, and all the rest is the surroundings. Every thermodynamic system can be classified into one of three kinds: an open system, where transfer of matter and energy between the system and the surroundings can occur, a closed system, where only energy can be transferred, and an isolated system, where there is no transfer of energy or matter.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig01.png)

The energy of a system means the ability of the system to perform work. Work is the energy required to move something against a resisting force. For example, when a gas has expanded, it has exerted work on its surroundings. In thermodynamics, the energy contained in the system is called the internal energy. It has been experimentally demonstrated that work and/or heat from the surroundings cause a change in internal energy.

### The First Law of Thermodynamics

The internal energy *U* is a state function that is defined solely by the system's current state (temperature, volume, etc.) and is independent of the path between states. Therefore, when a system is changed from its initial state to another state, the sum of work and heat exerted on the system is always the same and path-independent. We also know empirically that the internal energy of an isolated system is constant. This is the first law of thermodynamics (the law of conservation of energy), and expressed as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig02.png)

(*w*: work exerted on the system, *Q*: heat transfer to the system, ∆*U*: change in the internal energy)

### Enthalpy

When the volume of a system undergoes an infinitesimal volume change d*V* under a pressure *p*, infinitesimal work d'*w* from the surroundings can be expressed as follows (pressure-volume work).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig03.png)

When the pressure-volume work is the only work done on the system, the infinitesimal change in internal energy d*U* can be written as follows, from the equations (1) and (2).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig04.png)

(d′*Q*: infinitesimal heat, d′*w*: infinitesimal work)

When the internal energy is changed at a constant volume, then d*V* = 0. Therefore, the change in internal energy is equal to the heat transferred to the system. When the internal energy is changed under constant pressure, the heat transferred is not equal to the change in the internal energy, because the volume of the system can change. Therefore, a new state variable, enthalpy, is introduced as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig05.png)

An infinitesimal change in enthalpy can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig06.png)

Thus, when only pressure-volume work is exerted on the system under a constant pressure, from the equation (3),

![](images/ch4/ch4fig07.png)

That is, the change in the enthalpy is equal to the heat transferred. In other words, enthalpy is the energy contained in a system under a constant pressure.

### The Second Law of Thermodynamics

In our daily life, some phenomena can occur spontaneously and others not. For example, boiled water in a kettle spontaneously cools down to room temperature with time. On the contrary, water at room temperature never boils spontaneously. The difference between spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes can be summarized by the second law of thermodynamics (see section 38 \[2\]). Clausius expressed this law as: heat transfer from a warmer to a colder body is an irreversible process. In other words, heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change occurring at the same time.

"Irreversible" means that the system cannot return to the original state without some external work exerted on the system by its surroundings. On the contrary, in a reversible process, it is possible to return the system to its original state, without changing surroundings at all.

### Inequality of Clausius

Imagine a heat engine that receives heat *Q~i~* from ![](images/ch4/ch4fig08.png)*n* heat sources to perform work *w* in a cyclic process, then returns to the original state. With the temperature of each heat source being *T ~i~*,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig09.png)

holds\*. This is a mathematical representation of the second law of thermodynamics, called the inequality of Clausius. When *n* → ∞,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig10.png)

holds for any heat engine that continuously changes its state. In the inequalities (7) and (8), the left and right hand sides are equal when the cycle is a reversible process.

### Entropy

Entropy *S* is defined as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig11.png)

The left-hand side represents a reversible change from state A to a state B. In a cycle in which the system is changed from state A to B through an irreversible process, and then returned to A through a reversible process,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig12.png)

based on the inequality (8). Therefore,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig13.png)

based on the equation (9). Thus, for any change of state in general,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig14.png)

holds. For an infinitesimal change, it can be written as: d*S* ≥ d*Q*/*T*. In an adiabatic process,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig15.png)

because d′*Q* = 0. This is called the law of entropy increase, meaning that any spontaneous change in an isolated system does not cause a decrease in the entropy.

### Entropy in Statistical Mechanics

In statistical mechanics, entropy can be expressed as follows (Boltzmann's Principle).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig16.png)

*W* is the number of possible microscopic states of the system in a given macroscopic state. For example, for a given volume, the position of molecules in the system cannot be determined unequivocally. When a space of a volume *V* is divided into infinitesimal spaces of a volume δ*V* and n molecules are placed therein, the number of possible states is: *W* = (*V*⁄𝛿*V*)^n^. Therefore, most simply, an increase in the number of molecules and/or the volume results in an increase in the entropy.

The higher the entropy is, the larger *W* is, i.e., the more disordered the system is. Thus, the law of entropy increase means that, in a spontaneous process, the system moves toward a more random, disordered state.

\*For detailed derivation, see section 38 \[2\] and \[3\].

## 38. Free Energy and Chemical Equilibrium

Free energy is an important thermodynamic state variable that can serve as a measure of spontaneous process and equilibrium state. Gibbs energy is most frequently studied at constant temperature and pressure, which is also closely related to equilibrium constant.

### Gibbs Free Energy

When a state changes under a constant pressure and there is no work except pressure-volume work, then d*H* = d′*Q* (see section 37). Because d*S* ≥ d′*Q*⁄*T* from entropy equations, d*H* -*T*d*S* ≤ 0. Gibbs energy, a new thermodynamic state variable, is defined as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig17.png)

An infinitesimal change can be written as d*G* = d*H* - *T*d*S* - *S*d*T*. In an isothermal process,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig18.png)

from the above-mentioned inequality. In other words, in a system at constant pressure and temperature, a spontaneous change proceeds toward a minimum of the Gibbs energy. This principle is used to measure the favorability of a reaction in a typical chemical experiment, which is usually focused on a chemical reaction under a constant pressure.

### Pressure Dependence of Gibbs Energy

A reversible change in a closed system where the work is only pressure-volume work is discussed below. An infinitesimal change in three state variables (internal energy *U*, enthalpy *H*, and Gibbs energy *G*) can be rewritten as follows,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig19.png)

wherein each depends on infinitesimal changes in two other state variables. Then, when *G* is regarded as a function of temperature and pressure and totally differentiated, it can be expressed as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig20.png)

The subscripts in the derivative terms indicate the partial differentiation of *G* by *T* and *p*, with *p* and *T* being constant, respectively. By comparing the equations (5) and (6),

![](images/ch4/ch4fig21.png)

Because *S* and *V* always have positive values, Gibbs energy is decreased by an increase in temperature and increased by an increase in pressure.

When the pressure is changed from *p*~1~ to *p*~2~ at a constant temperature (d*T* = 0), the change in *G* is as follows based on the equation (5).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig22.png)

In the case of ideal gas, wherein *pV* = *nRT* (the combined gas law),

![](images/ch4/ch4fig23.png)

Based on the Gibbs energy *G*^0^ for the state of a pure form (standard conditions) under the standard pressure (*p*^0^ = 1 bar), the Gibbs energy under pressure *p* can be expressed as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig24.png)

Alternatively, it can be written as follows by choosing a system of measurement in which *p*^0^ = 1.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig25.png)

### Chemical Equilibrium

In a reversible reaction, when the rate of the forward reaction and the rate of the reverse reaction balance each other and the concentration of the substances does not change macroscopically, this state is called chemical equilibrium.

Look at the reversible reaction below.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig26.png)

The upper-case letters A, B, Y, and Z represent molecular species. Each *v~i~* is a stoichiometric coefficient for the corresponding species (the relative molar amount used in the reaction). When dn~A~ mol of A and dn~B~ mol of B have reacted in the forward reaction to produce dn~Y~ mol of Y and dn~Z~ mol of Z,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig27.png)

Therefore,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig28.png)

𝜉 is the advancement (see section 39).

At a constant temperature and pressure, the total differentiation of the Gibbs energy in this chemical reaction system is expressed as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig29.png)

𝜇~𝑖~ is a state variable called "chemical potential", and this can be regarded as the Gibbs energy per amount of substance of the component *i*. From the equation (12), the equation (13) can be rewritten as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig30.png)

Here, reaction Gibbs energy Δ~r~*G* is introduced as the change in the Gibbs energy due to the advancement of the reaction. Based on the equation (15),

![](images/ch4/ch4fig31.png)

Thus, Δ~r~*G* can be expressed as the difference in chemical potential between the reactants and the products in the reaction mixture composition. Because a spontaneous reaction proceeds toward a decrease in Gibbs energy, the forward reaction will dominate when Δ~r~*G* &lt; 0, whereas the reverse reaction will dominate when Δ~r~*G* &gt; 0. When Δ~r~*G* = 0, the reaction no longer proceeds in either direction, resulting in an equilibrium state.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig32.png)

### Equilibrium Constant and Gibbs Energy

In the case of an ideal gas, based on the equations (11) and (14),

![](images/ch4/ch4fig33.png)

*p*~i~ is the partial pressure of substance 𝑖. Therefore, using the standard Gibbs energy change,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig34.png)

the reaction Gibbs energy can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig35.png)

Because Δ~r~*G* = 0 in an equilibrium state,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig36.png)

based on the partial pressure *p*~i~^eq^ of each substance in the equilibrium state. When the ratio of the partial pressure of the reactants and products in the equilibrium state is represented by *K~p~*,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig37.png)

*K~p~* is called a pressure equilibrium constant.

If we consider a typical solution instead of an ideal gas, we use a physical quantity *a*~i~, called activity, instead of partial pressure, to express the following relationship:

![](images/ch4/ch4fig38.png)

The activity is usually a complex function of temperature, pressure, and amount of substance. The equation is similar to that of a molar fraction or any other concentration. In particular, in a dilute solution, it is equal to molar fraction 𝑥~𝑖~ = *n~𝑖~/n* \[1\]. An equilibrium constant based on activity

![](images/ch4/ch4fig39.png)

is called the "thermodynamic equilibrium constant", based on which Δ~r~*G*^0^ = −*RT* ln*K* in a typical solution.

In a dilute solution, the molar fraction of the solvent is substantially proportional to the molar concentration. Therefore, by approximation, the activity is often replaced with the concentration and the following equation based on the concentration equilibrium constant *K~c~* is used \[2\].

![](images/ch4/ch4fig40.png)

## 39. Reaction Kinetics

Reaction kinetics is deals with the temporal advancement of a reaction (reaction rate). In addition to typical chemical reactions, the reaction mechanisms of DNA hybridization, denaturation, and strand displacement have been investigated in terms of their reaction kinetics. This section outlines some basics of reaction kinetics.

### Reaction Rate Equation and Order of Reaction

Look at a chemical reaction below.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig41.png)

The advancement ξ, which describes the extent of the advancement of the reaction from the initial state, is used to express the molar amount of each component at time *t* as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig42.png)

Thus, the infinitesimal change in molar amount can be written as follows, relative to time.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig43.png)

When the volume *V* of the system is constant, the temporal change in the concentration of each component (\[A\] = *n*A⁄*V*, ...) can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig44.png)

*v* is called the reaction rate. An experimentally obtained reaction rate usually depends on the reactant concentration, which is expressed by the following equation using a reaction rate constant *k*.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig45.png)

This type of equation is called a "reaction rate equation", and the sum of the exponents *n* = *α* + *ß* +... is called the "overall reaction order". The exponent of each molecular species is called the order of reaction for that molecular species. In this case, the reaction is said to be *α*th in A and *ß*th in B.

### Elementary Reaction and Complex Reaction

A typical chemical reaction involves reaction intermediates, where the reaction proceeds stepwise as follows.

Reactants --&gt; Reaction intermediate --&gt; ... --&gt; Product

A single-step reaction with no intermediate is called an "elementary reaction", while a reaction composed of more than one elementary reaction (i.e. it proceeds stepwise) is called a "complex reaction". In its reaction mechanism, the complex reaction is expressed by the order of elementary reactions.

In a typical chemical reaction, the order of reaction does not correlate with the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactant. In an elementary reaction, they are equal to each other. For example, an elementary reaction:

2A + B -&gt; product

is a third-order reaction that is second order in A and first order in B. Therefore the rate equation can be written as follows.

*v*(*t*) = *k*\[A\]^2^\[B\]

### Integrated First-Order and Second-Order Reaction Equations

By integrating a rate equation, you can obtain the reactant and product concentration as a function of time, which is called an "integrated rate equation".

In a zero-order reaction, the reaction rate equation is written as *v*(*t*) = *k*, where the reaction proceeds at a constant rate in a concentration-independent manner. Therefore, the reactant concentration decreases linearly with time from the initial concentration \[A\]~0~, like \[A\] = \[A\]~0~ − *kt*. What about first-order and second-order reactions? Consider the first-order reaction below.

A -&gt; B

The reaction rate equation is as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig46.png)

This differential equation can be solved easily to provide the following integrated rate equation, with the initial concentration of A being \[A\]~0~.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig47.png)

Thus, in the first-order reaction, the reactant concentration decreases exponentially with time from the initial concentration. This equation can be rewritten as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig48.png)

This means that if a chemical reaction has been observed experimentally or otherwise to be a first-order reaction, the logarithm of the concentration will make a linear graph when plotted against time, and we can obtain reaction rate constant from the slope.

Below is an example of a second-order reaction. When there is only one reactant, the reaction rate equation is

![](images/ch4/ch4fig49.png)

and the integrated rate equation can be written as

![](images/ch4/ch4fig50.png)

or

![](images/ch4/ch4fig51.png)

When it includes two reactants, the reaction rate equation can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig52.png)

When the two reactants have the same concentration (\[A\] = \[B\]), the equation is the same as the equation for a single reactant. When they have different concentrations, an integrated rate equation can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig53.png)

### Reversible Reaction and Concentration Equilibrium Constant

Here we illustrate how to express a complex reaction using a reaction rate equation, with a simple reversible reaction as an example.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig54.png)

This reversible reaction is composed of the following two elementary reactions (forward (-&gt;) and reverse (&lt;-)).

\(1) ![](images/ch4/ch4fig55.png)

\(2) ![](images/ch4/ch4fig56.png)

The molecule A is consumed in the reaction (1) at the rate of *k*~1~\[A\]\[B\] and produced in the reaction (2) at the rate of *k* ~-1~\[Y\]\[Z\]. Thus, the apparent rate equation of the entire reaction can be written as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig57.png)

This can be solved either analytically or numerically to provide a concentration equation relative to time.

At equilibrium, where the reaction rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, the following equation holds.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig58.png)

This means that the concentration equilibrium constant *K~c~* and the reaction rate constant have the following relation.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig59.png)

### DNA Reactions and Reaction Kinetics

By approximation, a DNA reaction can also be described by a similar chemical reaction rate equation. We assume a two-state model (see section 41), in which a DNA molecule can only take a single-stranded form or a completely double-stranded form at a single point in time.

For example, the reaction shown in the figure below can be regarded as a second-order elementary reaction as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig60.png)

Therefore, you can experimentally observe the temporal change in fluorescence intensity (change in the concentration of *QL(overlined)*) by fluorometry (see section 81) and fit it to the integrated rate equation of a second-order reaction

![](images/ch4/ch4fig61.png)

to estimate the reaction rate constant *k* \[1\].

## 40. Molecular Structure of DNA

DNA, or *d*eoxyribo*n*ucleic *a*cid, is a macromolecule that carries genetic information in the nucleus or nucleoid of a cell; i.e., it stores the “program” essential to direct a biological system. This section describes the molecular structure of DNA.

### Double Helix

The double helix structure of DNA was reported by Watson and Crick in 1953 (Fig. 1)\[1\]. The diameter of the double helix is about 2 nm, and its length is about 3.4 nm per turn. The double helix contains two kinds of grooves that are different in width, with the wider one referred to as major groove and the narrower one as minor groove. When two DNA molecules wind around each other to form a double helix, we call this double-stranded DNA or a DNA double strand. When they are separated from each other, each we call them single-stranded DNA or a DNA single strand. A double helix usually exists as a "B form" structure, and as "A form" and "Z form" structures only under particular conditions. These forms have different geometries and dimensions (see the table below).

{width=80%}
![Fig. 1. DNA double helix.](images/ch4/ch4fig63.png)

Form |Chirality     |Diameter |Bases per turn |Rise per base
----:|:-------------|--------:|--------------:|--------------:
A    |Right-handed  |2.3 nm   |11             |0.26 nm
B    |Right-handed  |2 nm     |10.5           |0.34 nm
Z    |Left-handed   |1.8 nm   |12             |0.37 nm

### Bases


{width=50%,float=left}
![Fig. 2. Nucleotide and bases.](images/ch4/ch4fig64.png)

DNA is composed of four distinct bases, i.e., adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) (Fig. 2). Each base, together with a sugar and a phosphate, forms a "nucleotide" unit (Fig. 2). A compound made of a base bound to the 1' carbon atom in the sugar is called a nucleoside, and an ester compound made of a phosphate bound to the 5' position of the nucleoside is called a nucleotide \[2\]. In a single strand DNA, its terminus at a 5' carbon atom is called a 5' end, and that at a 3' carbon atom is called a 3' end. The strand is written in the 5' to 3' direction (see Fig. 2). Two DNA strands in a double strand DNA run in opposite directions (antiparallel).


### Base Pairing and Complementary Strands

{width=50%,float=left}
![Fig. 3. Base pairing between DNA strands](images/ch4/ch4fig65.png)

In a DNA double helix, bases in the DNA form Watson-Crick base pairs through hydrogen bonding. A Watson-Crick base pair can be formed only between A and T or between G and C (Fig. 3). An A/T pair is formed by two hydrogen bonds, while a G/C pair is formed by three hydrogen bonds, providing a stronger interaction. As a result, a double helix with a higher GC content is more stable \[2\]. For example, the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3' can form a stable double helix only with 5'-TACGCAT-3'. This property of bases is called complementarity, and these sequences are called mutually complementary sequences or complementary strands. In addition, when multiple base pairs are formed consecutively in a helix, they stack up to stabilize each other. This interaction between base pairs is called stacking. In this manner, the DNA double helix is stabilized both through the hydrogen bonding of Watson-Crick base pairs and the stacking between base pairs. The length of DNA is expressed in the number of nucleotides (bases) (nt) when it is in a single-strand state, and in the number of base pairs (bp) when in a double-strand state. For example, a single strand DNA of 20 bases is 20 nt long, a double strand DNA made of two completely complementary 20 nt-long strands is 20 bp long.


### Melting and Hybridization of DNA

The double helix structure of DNA resolves into single strands under heat, which is called denaturation or melting. The reverse reaction (double strand formation) is called hybridization. DNA is stable from 0˚C to 100˚C, so that the melting and hybridization can be repeated again and again by multiple heating/cooling cycles \[2\].

{aside}
**Column: RNA**

RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a macromolecule that is very similar to DNA. There are two major differences between them. First, the nucleotide sugar in RNA is a ribose with a hydroxyl group (-OH) present on the 2' position. Second, RNA uses a base U (uracil), instead of T (thymine) in DNA. U and T have the same structure except for one methyl group (-CH~3~) that is present only in T.

## 41. Thermodynamics of DNA Hybridization

DNA forms base pairs between A and T or G and C (see section 40). The association of two mutually complementary DNA strands through base pairing is called hybridization. The stability of hybridization can be estimated thermodynamically.

### DNA Hybridization: Two-State Model

In a short DNA strand of about 100 bases or less, the hybridization can be modeled as the chemical equilibrium of a reaction that involves only two states: a single-strand state before and a double-strand state after hybridization. This is called a two-state model. This model may not be applicable to a longer DNA of kilobases or more, because partial dissociation of base pairs can occur.

### DNA Hybridization and Melting Temperature

Let a single strand DNA be *S*, a complementary single strand DNA be S*(overlined)*, and a double strand DNA formed by them be *D*. In the two-state model, the chemical equilibrium is as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig66.png)

With the initial DNA concentration (concentration immediately after mixing) being \[*S*\] = \[*S(overlined)*\] = *C* and the hybridized fraction in the equilibrium state being *α,* the equilibrium constant K is as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig67.png)

Thermodynamically (see sections 37 and 38), with regard to free energy ∆*G*, enthalpy ∆*H*, and entropy ∆*S*,

∆*G* = -*RT* ln*K* \[3\]

∆*G* = ∆*H* - *T*∆*S* \[4\]

holds (*T*: absolute temperature; *R* =1.987 x 10^-3^ \[kcal mol^-1^ K^-1^\]: gas constant; ln: log~e~ ). From this,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig68.png)

Here, the temperature at which the ratio of hybridized DNA molecules to single-stranded DNA molecules is 1:1 is called the melting temperature (*T~m~*). Because *α* = 0.5 and T = *T~m~*, the equation \[5\] can be transformed into

![](images/ch4/ch4fig69.png).

If the initial concentration *C* and the thermodynamic parameters ∆*H* and ∆*S* are known, *T~m~* can be calculated. *T~m~* is a widely used measure of stability of DNA hybridization. A higher *T~m~* indicates a higher stability of hybridization.

### Intramolecular Reaction and Melting Temperature of DNA

The stability of a DNA structure with intramolecular base pairing, such as a hairpin, can also be estimated from its melting temperature. Such an intramolecular reaction is not called hybridization, but still can be handled similarly. Imagine a single strand DNA *S* and its hairpin structure state *H*. In the two-state model,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig70.png){width="3.75625in" height="0.5399617235345582in"}

With the initial DNA concentration being \[*S*\] = *C* and the fraction of the hairpin form in an equilibrium state being *α*,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig71.png){width="3.75625in" height="0.5465037182852144in"}

Similarly,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig72.png)

*T~m~* does not depend on *C*, unlike in a hybridization reaction.

### Calculation of Free Energy ∆G and Prediction of *T~m~* Using the Nearest-Neighbor Method

Now you can calculate the *T~m~*, i.e. the stability of DNA, once you know its thermodynamic parameters ∆*H* and ∆*S*. This is called the Nearest-Neighbor (NN) method. The NN method calculates ∆*H* and ∆*S*, and is introduced using the DNA in FIG. 1 as an example. In this model, the stacking interaction between neighboring base pairs, rather than the energy of hydrogen bonding in each base pair, is considered to dominate the stability of hybridization. In the case of the DNA in FIG. 1, each base pair is paired with a neighboring base pair, from the left to the right, as follows.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig73.png)

∆*H* and ∆*S* for each pair (Table 1) are summed up to obtain the ∆*H* and ∆*S* of the entire DNA hybridized. The effect of strand termini can be calculated using GC-term and AT-term in Table 1. Thus,

![](images/ch4/ch4fig74.png)

Similarly,

∆*S* = -0.4827 \[kcal x mol^-1^ x K^-1^\]

When the initial concentration *C* = 0.5 mM,

*T~m~* = 345.48 \[K\] = 72.3 \[°C\]

from the equation \[6\]. Note that this is a value in 1 M Na^+^. The salt concentration dependence of *T~m~* is due to the salt concentration dependence of ∆*S*. Empirically,

∆*S*(\[Na^+^ \]) = ∆*S*(1 M)+ 0.368*N* ln(\[Na^+^ \] M) \[10\]

where N is the number of stacks (base length: -1) \[2\]. For example, in 0.1 M Na^+^,

*T~m~* = 332.80 \[K\] = 59.6 \[°C\]

because

∆*S*(0.1 M) = ∆*S*(1 M)+ 0.368 × (23-1) × ln(0.1)

= -0.50225 \[kcal ⋅mol^-1^ ⋅K^-1^\]

That is, a lower salt concentration results in a lower *T~m~*.

Last, we discuss a structure with an unpaired base (mismatch) such as a hairpin loop and a bulge loop. In this case, the NN method is not enough; we need a parameter to account for the mismatch. For example, for a loop made of *n* bases, the following holds (Jacobson-Stockmayer equation).

∆*H* = 0

∆*S* (n &gt; 9) = DS(9)-1.75*R* ln(*n*/9)

∆*S* for *n* ≤ 9 is shown in Table 2.

## 42. Strand Displacement

A basic technique to implement a dynamic system in the field of DNA nanotechnology is a DNA strand displacement reaction. This reaction replaces a strand in a double helix with a third strand. This reaction has much fewer restrictions on buffer, temperature, and other conditions than an enzymatic reaction, and only involves DNA. It is employed in the transformation of DNA nanostructures and the conversion of DNA sequences.

### Replacement of a Strand in a Double Helix

Techniques to assemble static nanostructures from double helical DNA units have significantly progressed (see section 17). One advancement is a technique that solely relies on DNA to achieve a system capable of dynamic changes \[1\] (see section 23); this technique is based on the DNA strand displacement reaction (DSD) shown in Fig. 1. It is also called a "toehold-mediated strand displacement".

In the initial state, the green and red DNA strands form a double helix. When the blue single strand DNA is inputted, it forms a double helix with the red DNA, releasing the green DNA as a single strand. The number of hydrogen bonds between complementary bases is greater after the reaction, indicating that the post-reaction state is more favorable in terms of free energy (see section 38).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig76.png)

Fig. 1. Strand displacement reaction.

### Reaction Proceeds through Branch Migration

This reaction proceeds from the left to the right through more than one intermediate state. Some intermediate states are shown in Fig. 2. At first, the blue DNA hybridizes to the single-stranded, leftmost region in the red DNA. Then, the blue and green DNA strands, which are partially identical to each other, compete for hydrogen bonding to the red DNA strand.

The site of the competition is called a "branching point", which wanders to the left and the right. This reaction is called "branch migration". In the end, as shown in the right in Fig. 1, the blue DNA completely replaces the green DNA to form a stable double helix with the red DNA, releasing the green DNA as a single strand.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig77.png)

Fig. 2. Intermediate states in the strand displacement reaction with the branching point wandering to the left and the right, which is called branch migration.

### Fuel Drives Reaction

Usually, the reaction is schematically depicted by omitting the double helix structure, and representing each DNA by an arrow from the 5' end to the 3' end (see Fig. 3). The sequence is divided into two or more reaction units, each labeled with a letter. In this figure, each uppercase letter and the corresponding lower case letter represent mutually complementary sequences.

When the green single strand DNA is regarded as an output, the blue DNA is a "fuel" to drive the reaction, and the blue/red complete double helix after the reaction is a waste product. The region a in the red DNA, which is initially single-stranded, is called a "toehold" to initiate the reaction.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig78.png)

### Fig. 3.** Schematically depicted strand displacement reaction and components.

### Toehold Sequence Determines Reaction Rate

The reaction rate depends on the length of the toehold sequence and the DNA concentration. To understand the reaction rate, we can consider Fig. 3 to be a two-molecule reaction that can be expressed by a chemical reaction equation. The reaction rate constant (*k*) can be changed by manipulating the length (*n*) of the toehold sequence a. According to \[2\], when the sequence b to be displaced is 20 base long in 11.5 mM MgCl~2~ at 25˚C, the following equation can estimate an approximate value of *k*.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig79.png)

As understood from the equation, when the toehold sequence is lengthened by 1, 2, …, 6 bases, the value of the rate constant increases exponentially, by 10, 100, …, 1000000-fold. Above 6 bases, it reaches a plateau. For example, when the initial concentration of two molecules in the left hand side is 10 nM, the time necessary to consume 50% of the starting material can be adjusted by orders of magnitude, eg. 3 minutes for 6 bases, 30 minutes for 5 bases, 5 hours for 4 bases.... This property is important when applying the strand displacement reaction to more complex systems (see section 28).

For more detailed analysis, the reaction can be divided into three steps: hybridization (two-molecule reaction), denaturation (single-molecule reaction), and branch migration \[2\]. For computer-aided analysis and design of the reaction, an online simulator is available (see section 67). To experimentally determine the exact rate constant, the reaction can be subjected to fluorometric time-lapse observation in a test tube (see sections 51 and 81).

### Variations of Strand Displacement Reaction

The above is a basic strand displacement reaction. Many variations have been reported that incorporate ingenious sequence combinations. Fig. 4 schematically shows a "toehold exchange"\[2\], which employs two toehold sequences to allow both forward and reverse reactions, a "remote toehold"\[3\], which controls the reaction rate by placing a linker between the toehold sequence and the sequence to be displaced, and an "associative toehold activation" \[4\], which is based on a fuel composed of multiple molecules.

## 43. Secondary Structures of DNA

The secondary structure of a DNA molecule is defined by the set of base pairs formed in the DNA molecule. In order to construct a DNA-based molecular robot, you have to predict the behavior of a given DNA molecule, and design a base sequence that will work exactly as expected. To prepare for that, this section discusses secondary DNA structures.

### Secondary Structure of DNA

In solution, DNA can form a variety of structures. This is because it contains a multiple base pairs made through hydrogen bonding between mutually complementary bases (see section 41). Here, the structure of a DNA described by the identity of base pairs along the base sequence is called the secondary structure of DNA (see below).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig81.png)

A secondary structure may be composed of a single DNA molecule or a plurality of DNA molecules, but with the proviso that every base pair is only formed between two bases. Actually, three bases can form a triple-stranded structure through non-canonical hydrogen bonding, or two or more base pairs can interact with each other, resulting in higher DNA structures. However, in most practical cases, you will just have to consider the secondary structure. Consideration of any higher structures comes later (see Column: Protein Structures).

### Different Secondary Structures

There are various secondary structures, which are named after their shapes (see below).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig82.png)

-**Dangling end**: a single-stranded region at the end of a DNA strand, with no hydrogen bond.
-**Hairpin loop**: a hairpin-like loop structure. Includes only one base pair.
-**Stacking pair**: consecutive base pairs.
-**Bulge loop**: a structure that contains a loop in only one of the two DNA strands. Includes two base pairs.
-**Internal loop**: a structure that contains a loop in each of the two DNA strands. Includes two base pairs.
-**Multibranch loop**: a loop from which three or more helices exit. Includes three or more base pairs.

Although not depicted in the figure, DNA can also form a "pseudoknot" structure. For details of these structures, see \[1\] and other texts.

### Secondary Structure Prediction and Design

In order to manufacture parts of a molecular robot from DNA and control them, you need two techniques (see below).

![](images/ch4/ch4fig83.png)

One is to predict the structure of a given base sequence in a solution and its stability, which is called "secondary structure prediction" of DNA (see section 63). Another is to find a DNA sequence that will form a desired structure, which is called "sequence design" of DNA (see section 64). Both techniques are basic to and essential for controlling chemical reactions of DNA.

**Column: Protein Structures**

Like DNA, proteins make various structures *in vivo*, but in a far more complex manner. Proteins have tertiary and quaternary structures that result from complex combinations of ionic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and the like as well as hydrogen bonding. For a typical DNA assembly, you will only have to consider its secondary structure. For most proteins, however, you will have to take their tertiary and/or higher structures into account.

By analogy with parts of a robot, you can understand why most people use DNA to make programmable biological parts, instead of proteins.

Parts for a robot or a similar system must be designed to work exactly as expected, but the structure of a protein is very difficult to predict, seriously hindering designing one.

In the future, however, a day might come when we can overcome this technological limitation and design any desired protein and accurately predict and control its behaviors. If so, it will lead to extremely useful biological robots, because proteins have diverse functions that are not possible with DNA.

## 44. DNA Synthesis

In the field of life sciences, chemically synthesized DNA plays an essential role in genome sequencing, DNA profiling in criminal investigations, viral genotyping in the medical field, and almost all processes in biotechnology that have something to do with genes.

### Phosphoramidite Method

The most common method to chemically synthesize DNA is the solid-phase phosphoramidite method. In this method, the starting material is the first base of a desired DNA that is linked to a solid phase carrier (*c*ontrolled *p*ore *g*lass column) through an ester bond. To its 5' end, then, nucleic acid monomers are coupled one base at a time. These "phosphoramidite" monomers, named after a phosphate diester precursor moiety contained in their chemical structure, have protecting groups introduced on the base moiety, the 5' hydroxyl group of the deoxyribose, and the phosphoramidite moiety.

The phosphoramidite method is composed of a total of six reaction steps.

![](images/ch4/ch4fig84.png)

### Step (1): detritylation

Both the first base on the CPG column and the phosphoramidite monomer are protected with a dimethoxytrityl (DMTr) group at the 5' hydroxyl group. In the reaction scheme, the 5' end of the DNA molecule being synthesized is always protected by the DMTr group, except during the coupling. This step removes the DMTr group using acid (3% TCA/dichloromethane) to expose the 5'-hydroxyl group, which subsequently serves as a reaction site.

### Step (2): activation

The phosphoramidite moiety is activated to allow its coupling to the 5'-hydroxyl group produced in the detritylation step. Specifically, an activating agent such as 1-tetrazole is mixed with the phosphoramidite monomer in a solution.

### Step (3): coupling

The activated phosphoramidite monomer is then introduced into the CPG column and coupled to the 5'-hydroxyl group.

### Step (4): capping

When the reaction is successful, about 99% of the starting material is now one base longer (i.e., its 5' end has the DMTr group derived from the phosphoramidite monomer). However, the remaining 1% still has the hydroxyl group at the 5' end unreacted, which will react with a phosphoramidite monomer in the subsequent cycle, resulting in an unwanted side-product that is one base shorter. To avoid this, the unreacted 5'-hydroxyl group is destroyed using acetic anhydride.

### Step (5): oxidation

The phosphorus from the phosphoramidite monomer is in a trivalent form. It is oxidized into a pentavalent phosphate diester.

Steps (1) to (5) are repeated the number of times that is equal to the number of bases required, before step (6).

### Step (6): detachment/deprotection

The CPG column is then charged with a concentrated aqueous ammonia solution and left at room temperature for 1 hour. This cleaves the ester bond between the solid phase carrier and the first base, releasing the DNA product into the concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. Because all the protecting groups present on the phosphoramidite monomer, except DMTr, are designed to be removable under basic conditions, you can remove them by directly heating this concentrated aqueous ammonia solution at 55 ˚C for 16 hours.

After that, the sample is subjected to DMTr removal and desalting through a DNA purification column (see section 78).

{aside}
**Column: Avoid Moisture**
In the phosphoramidite method, you must note that the steps (2) and (3) are extremely sensitive to moisture, because water competitively inhibits the coupling of the 5' hydroxyl group to the phosphoramidite moiety. Because reagents for automated synthesizer easily absorb moisture, you must not let them contact air for too long. Some laboratories have a saying a rainy day is not for DNA synthesis. Many providers of custom DNA synthesis services are located in Hokkaido, where there is no east Asian rainy season.
{/aside}

### Automated DNA Synthesizer

Conveniently, this whole process can be done automatically by an automated DNA synthesizer. Automated DNA synthesizers from ABI, which were once employed in many laboratories, are no longer produced. Repair parts are not readily available either. If you have a chance to use one, take good care of it. At present, equivalents are available from Nihon Techno Service (http://www.ntsbio.com). There is also a foreign supplier of instruments that can synthesize up to 192 different DNA samples simultaneously (http://bioautomation.com), without which the DNA origami technique based on multiple staple structures would never have come into existence.

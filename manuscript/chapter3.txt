# What Does Design of DNA Molecules Make Possible?

## 17. Structural DNA Nanotechnology: Overview

Structural DNA nanotechnology can produce various shapes using DNA molecules as material. This section outlines the molecular nature of DNA, basic structures that can be assembled from it, and three approaches currently used to assemble such structures.

### DNA Molecule

When asked what is DNA, most of you will answer, "genes." This is a correct answer in a biology class. However, have you ever thought of DNA simply as a "molecule" with a defined shape? Chemically, DNA is just a molecule made of a long string ("polymer") of "nucleotide" units, each of which consists of a sugar, base, and phosphate. DNA in this form is sometimes called "single-stranded DNA".

![](images/ch3fig1.png)

There are 4 kinds of bases: A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine). A base sequence is obtained by reading out bases in a single strand of DNA from one end to the other. DNA has a directionality, with one of its ends called the 5' terminus and the other the 3' terminus (based on the positions of two phosphates attached to a sugar), wherein its sequence is read from the 5’ terminus (as seen from the figure, the direction is often indicated by an arrow).

"DNA=genes" because organisms recognize DNA base sequences as information that guides a variety of biological activities including protein synthesis. Although DNA itself is just a molecule, organisms use it as a "data storage medium" to record/read out a set of information that matters to them.

As you know, the structure of DNA is a double helix. Two single strands of DNA that run in opposite directions stick to each other along their length to create this form, in which the bases also play an essential role. Each base has a property of "complementarity", so that only a specific partner can stick to it through hydrogen bonding, i.e. A to T and C to G. Two single DNA strands with mutually complementary sequences stick (hybridize) to each other along their length through hydrogen bonding between bases, forming this double helix structure of double strands. Strictly speaking, hydrophobic interactions between adjacent bases in the same strand are also involved in the double helix structure formation, but we will not discuss that here. In terms of engineering, you can expect that, even when a large number of DNA molecules with different sequences are present in an aqueous solution, any of them will only stick to a complementary DNA molecule to form a double strand, i.e. the double helix structure. See sections 41 to 44 for more details.

### Components of DNA Nanostructure

As discussed above, from an engineering point of view, you can regard DNA as a material with an interesting property: i.e., a string-shaped molecule that can stick to another one or more to spontaneously form a double helix, The process of matching one string to another is guided by internal base sequences. As described in section 45, today we can chemically synthesize a DNA molecule of any sequence. As a result, a pair of complementary sequences in a given site can be designed to be as dissimilar to those in other sites as possible (these are called orthonormal sequences), so that double helix-forming sites are appointed unequivocally. Because of our ability to create these structures, researchers initially investigated branched structures and sticky ends of DNA . These two features also serve as key components in the design of more complex DNA nanostructures, as discussed below.

#### Branched Structure

![](images/ch3fig2.png)

As an example, in the left Figure, the regions (a) and (c) in the first DNA have, by design, a sequence complementary to a region of the fourth DNA and to a region in the second DNA, respectively. Four different DNA molecules thus make this four-arm branched structure because only mutually complementary regions can hybridize to form a double helix. By dividing each DNA molecule into multiple regions and designing each region to stick to a specific region in the same or another DNA molecule, you can assemble not only a straight chain of double helix, but also more complex two-dimensional structures. At present, the most commonly used DNA nanostructure components include four-armed branches as described above (one without any single strand region b is sometimes called a crossover junction) and similarly designed three-armed branches.

#### Sticky Ends

![](images/ch3fig3.png)

Another important component of creating DNA nanostructures is sticky ends. Imagine two double strand DNA molecules (red and blue in the figure), each provided with a single strand overhang (a or b in the figure) in its terminus. If the base sequences a and b are mutually complementary, the two double helices are joined together through the hybridization of a and b. Such single stranded (i.e. a and b) regions are called "sticky ends". This technique is frequently used to join units into a large structure by the "glue"-like function that allows selective binding between their termini.

### Three Approaches

How should you apply these concepts, i.e. branches and sticky ends, to assemble a DNA structure? Currently there are three major approaches to the assembly of structures using DNA.

1\. Folding (e.g. DNA origami and tiles)

2\. Network formation (e.g. DNA hydrogel)

3\. Connector-like function (e.g. SNA)

These approaches can be distinguished by the different ways they direct a DNA molecule. In the folding approach, DNA double helices are bundled to form a desired nanostructure. Each double helix is regarded as a "tube", and, in principle, the structure is designed to form by joining the tubes. Techniques that rely primarily on folding include DNA origami, DNA tiles composed of a variety of DNA motifs, and recently reported DNA bricks. DNA hydrogel is a relatively new assembly approach, which considers a long double helix made of a plurality of joined DNA molecules as a "flexible macromolecule structure", not as a rigid tube. DNA hydrogel combines such structures to form a network, or gel, on the macro scale. In SNA, which is described in section 21, the selective binding ability intrinsic to DNA is more important than its structure, and DNA is used as "a glue with a length and a selective action". In this approach, DNA molecules are attached to gold nanoparticles to control the interaction between them and thus the crystallization of the nanoparticles.

These approaches will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

## 18. Two-Dimensional DNA Origami

DNA origami structures, now a prominent field of study in DNA nanotechnology and the most popular subject of BIOMOD projects, started with a DNA smiley face published in *Nature* magazine in 2006. That article outlined the principles underlying the design of their various elaborate structures. We explain a few principles here.

### Structural Basis of DNA Origami

Every DNA Origami structure is made of only two kinds of components, i.e., a long single-stranded DNA chain designated as "scaffold chain" and multiple short single-stranded DNA chains designated as "staple chains". The scaffold chain serves as a scaffold to assemble the structure. Usually the chain is M13mp18 ssDNA, a circular single-stranded DNA of 7,249 bases. This is the genome of the M13 bacteriophage which infects E. coli and can be prepared from the organism in a highly homogeneous manner. Any single strand DNA can be prepared using this bacteriophage, and it had been widely used as a DNA sequence analysis tool before modern DNA sequencers were developed. As a result, it is still available from biology reagent suppliers at a reasonable price. M13mp18 ssDNA is generally used in its circular form. It may also be used after linearization by enzymatic cleavage, which is, however, not recommended because the assembly of the origami structure will be incomplete when the cleavage does not occur quantitatively. Similarly, in order to assemble larger DNA origami structures, scaffold chains other than M13mp18 ssDNA (e.g., a fragment of the lambda phage genome) have been tested and reported, but seem to achieve less consistent assembly than M13mp18 ssDNA.

The single scaffold chain is folded like the weft thread in a fabric and formed into a desired planar structure by the action of the staple chains, which are generally 32 bases long. In order to assemble a DNA origami structure, DNA double helices have to be bundled like a wooden raft, similar to those in DX tiles. This can be achieved by introducing a crossover between the second helix and the third helix at a position that is 1.5 helical turns away from a crossover between the first helix and the second helix. This corresponds to 10.5 x 1.5 = 15.75 bases because the periodicity of a B-type DNA double helix is 10.5 base pairs. However, this is usually rounded to 16 bases because the decimal fractions in the number of bases are somewhat difficult to handle. That is, in a DNA origami structure, a staple chain bridges helices every 16 bases. Sixteen bases in the 32 bases correspond to this "region complementary to the second helix", while the staple chain also has to bind to the first and third helices. Thus, 8 bases complementary to the first helix and 8 bases complementary to the third helix are added to the aforementioned 16 bases, resulting in 32 bases total. As a result, in a DNA origami structure, the staple chains are bended in an S shape and/or a Z shape to bind to the scaffold chain. This might seem unimportant, but every helix has its handedness. Therefore, it is important to note that whether a staple chain is arranged in an S shape or a Z shape can make a large difference. That is, when a staple chain is arranged in an S shape, the termini of the staple chain will be the rear most objects in the design. When it is arranged in a Z shape, they will be the fore most objects in the design. This should be taken into consideration when the staple chain is to have an additional DNA chain or the like hanging from it. In order to fold the 7,249-base scaffold chain by means of 32-base staple chains, 7249/32 = 226.5 so 226.5 staple chains are required in the simplest calculation. Because the M13mp18 genome sequence can be regarded basically as random, two hundreds and several tens of DNA chains with mutually different sequences are required. Preparing their mixture might feel like a hard job, but the beauty of the resulting structure will reward you for all your trouble.

### Assembly and Observation of DNA Origami Structures

Once you have obtained the appropriate design and corresponding staple chains, a DNA origami structure can be assembled by a very simple procedure. By simply dissolving the scaffold chain and an excess amount (generally about 5 equivalents) of the staple chains in 1 x TAE/Mg^2+^ buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 2 mM EDTA, and 12.5 mM Mg^2+^ included), which is commonly used in DNA nanotechnology, and slowly cooling it from 90˚C to 25˚C (this is referred to as annealing), each staple chain will find their target regions complementary in the scaffold chain, folding the scaffold chain into the desired structure. You must always include a divalent cation (generally Mg^2+^) in the solution. Each DNA chain carries a high net negative charge due to its phosphodiester bonds, and thus cannot by itself form a dense structure of helices such as are required in DNA Origami, due to static repulsion. Thanks to the divalent cation, this repulsion can be neutralized and the helices bridged.

A divalent cation is also indispensable in observing a DNA origami structure. A two-dimensional, thin and planar DNA origami structure is usually observed under an atomic force microscope (AFM). When the DNA origami solution is added dropwise onto the highly planar structure of freshly cleaved mica, the negative charge on the mica surface and the negative charge of the DNA origami structure are bridged and neutralized by the divalent cation. As a result, the DNA origami structure beautifully adheres to the mica surface. This adhesion is so strong that even tapping by the AFM probe will not easily peel off the DNA origami structure. Thus, if your assembly has gone as planned, you will observe the desired Origami structure with a thickness of 2 nm (i.e., that of a DNA double helix).

Column: Flipbook Cartoon Made of DNA Origami

![](images/ch3fig6.png)

In BIOMOD 2013, Team Kansai from Kansai University reported a "DNA Origami flipbook cartoon", composed of a total of 10 AFM images, of "the Rabbit and the Turtle", and won the gold prize. Their idea of minimizing the number of the staples by connecting the ground, turtle, and rabbit through linkers was admired. The team also assembled a background layer of a roadside tree passing by via DNA origami, and got to the final in the Intercollegiate Science Competition sponsored by MEXT.

## 19. Three-Dimensional DNA Origami

"Origami" models well known to Japanese researchers include "crane" and other three-dimensional structures as well as two-dimensional structures such as "samurai helmet" and "yakko-san" (samurai's attendant). Several techniques for three-dimensional structure assembly have also been devised using nanoscale DNA origami.

In principle, the three-dimensional DNA origami structures reported so far can be divided into two classes.

### Three-Dimensional Hollow DNA Origami

The earliest three-dimensional DNA origami structures were hollow polyhedrons, each assembled from separate planar parts, which were reported by four groups almost at the same time in 2009 \[1-4\]. Two of them were box-shaped and designed to be intentionally "opened and closed" for their future use as nanocontainers (the other two were a regular tetrahedron and prism, respectively). In the structure made by Anderson _et al._, the faces are joined in a manner that allows only one face of the cube (about 40 nm square) to open/close like a lid \[1\]. The lid is kept closed by two different pairs of one DNA strand and another partially complementary strand. Addition of completely complementary DNA strands can selectively open the lid. The author's group calls the DNA strand pairs that keep the lid closed "locks" and the DNA strands that open the lid "keys". Afterward, Anderson _et al._ also made a smaller box-shaped structure that operates by the same mechanism \[5\].

The earliest "nanomechanical DNA origami device" independently made by the author's group is also a cubic, box-shaped DNA origami structure (about 40 nm square), but its operating mechanism somewhat differs from that of the above example \[2\]. In the first step to make this structure, two units, each composed of three mutually perpendicular faces, are joined through a hinge to form one "open structure". Then the open structure is turned into a box-shaped "closed structure" by the addition of a trigger DNA strand. Recently, it has been successfully used as a nanocarrier to selectively contain a single gold nanoparticle 10 nm in diameter \[6\]. Selective uptake of a gold nanoparticle into a similar lidded, box-shaped DNA origami structure has also been reported by Sugiyama _et al._ \[7\]. This system employs an artificial photoreactive base to assemble a DNA origami structure, which allows a light-triggered structural change.

Once the box-shaped structures as described above are opened, there is now way to keep them in the open state. Therefore, their free motion in an aqueous solution provides a driving force to open these structures. Firrao _et al._ reported an exemplary DNA origami structure that can be opened/closed by a more active driving force. They created a tubular DNA origami structure with a similar hatch that is driven by double strand DNA formation, and showed that it actually worked.

Hollow three-dimensional DNA origami structures can include curved surfaces, by virtue of the ability to bend DNA strands in a DNA origami \[8\]. For example, Yan _et al._ have successfully assembled flask- and sphere-shaped DNA origami structures.

Honeycomb Three-Dimensional DNA Origami

Another category of three-dimensional DNA origami structures is the honeycomb three-dimensional DNA origami \[9\].

![](images/ch3fig9.png)

Reprinted with permission from *Nature 2009.*

These structures will be more familiar to BIOMOD participants who use caDNAno. In actual situations, a hollow DNA origami structure in an aqueous solution will be subject to substantial fluctuation, because DNA itself is very flexible. On the other hand, such fluctutations will not occur in a honeycombed three-dimensional DNA origami, which is a solid three-dimensional structure formed by folding one origami sheet in a multilayer geometry. This technique can even introduce bends and twists into any three-dimensional structure, by carefully choosing the length of the DNA components and stacking differently sized layers \[10\]. Today, a plurality of such curved structures can be combined to make previously impossible complex three-dimensional nanostructures, such as a huge bird cage-like structure. Recently, a structure with an ion channel-like function that can pierce through a liposome has been created. \[11\].

## 20. DNA Tiles

Among DNA nanostructure assembly techniques, the "DNA tile" technique is used to make patterned two-dimensional structures and three-dimensional crystals. This section describes DNA tile basics, taking two-dimensional DNA motifs as an example. We also introduce the basic idea of a so-called "algorithmic self-assembly" technique.

DNA tiles = motifs + sticky ends

DNA tile is a representative assembly technique to assemble a nanostructure by DNA folding. It is like a jigsaw puzzle, which is assembled by joining small pieces one by one, at the molecular scale.

![](images/ch3fig10.png)

Adapted with permission from \[1\].

Here, a structural unit composed of more than one DNA double helix ("motif") corresponds to a jigsaw puzzle piece. In the case of a jigsaw puzzle, pieces have different shaped tabs and slots on their edges, which determine how the pieces are joined. In the case of DNA tiles, sticky ends play this role. DNA tiles can be joined together only when their sticky ends have mutually complementary sequences. In an actual jigsaw puzzle, you have to join pieces by hand. In DNA tiles, structures form spontaneously in an aqueous solution through Brownian motion and hybridization. This is called self-assembly. Specifically, slow cooling or "annealing" (see section 76) is employed to achieve a thermodynamically stable state (i.e. "a state that provides a long double helix"). During the cooling, each set of DNA molecules in the solution forms a tile, after which the tiles self-assemble to form a two/three-dimensional structure (i.e., in the case of DNA, puzzle pieces themselves are also spontaneously formed in the solution). Motifs that make up DNA tiles and an "algorithmic self-assembly" technique to form DNA tile-based patterns are outlined below.

DNA Motifs

A "repeat unit" structure made of a combination of branched DNA structures is called a DNA motif. The most representative motif used for DNA tiles is the double crossover (DX) molecule structure. In an aqueous solution that contain magnesium ions or the like to suppress the electrostatic repulsion between DNA molecules, a four-arm branched (crossover) structure can have a closed conformation as shown in the left or right in panel a. However, in this state, the conformation cannot be unequivocally specified because the branch still can move freely like a hinge. In panel b, two branches are provided between two double helices to fix their conformation, which is called a double crossover.

![](images/ch3fig11.png)

Adapted with permission from \[1\].

In double crossover (DX) tiles, the dimensions and sticky ends are carefully chosen so that double helices from adjacent tiles will be in phase, as shown in c \[2\]. These sticky ends can be interlocked to form a planar structure of two dimensionally joined tiles. This structure looks like a bundle of double helices that are arranged parallel to each other.

Similarly, triple crossover (TX) tiles have been reported, which are bundles of three double helices, (a) \[3\], n-point star with rotational symmetry (b) \[4\], cross-tile, which is a four-arm branch motif (c) \[5\], and single-stranded tile (SST), composed of a single strand which becomes double helical only when it is incorporated into the final assembly (d) \[6\].

![](images/ch3fig12.png)

The authors have developed the T-motif \[7\], which is composed of T-branched structures instead of crossover branches. This can produce structures on mica or other substrates, serving as a platform to form a desired pattern of nanoparticles and proteins over a considerably large area.

### Algorithmic Self-Assembly

When DNA tiles have only one kind of sticky end, you will get a uniform two-dimensional planar structure made of identical tiles. What if more than one kind of sticky end is present: e.g., two sticky end pairs 1 and 0? When the right side of a tile A can be joined to the left side of a tile B through 1 and the right side of B to the left side of A through 0, a structure composed of alternate repetitions of A and B will form (panel. a).

![](images/ch3fig14.png)

Reprinted with permission from \[1\].

One such structure was actually made and showed a striped pattern of alternating protrusion-containing A tiles and protrusion-less B tiles (b) under atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Similarly, the use of more and more sets of sticky ends (and thus more and more different tiles) can provide more complex patterns. For example, assume four different tiles that each carry a distinct combination of sticky ends 1 and 0, as shown in panel a below.

![](images/ch3fig15.png)

Reprinted with permission from Natural Computing ©2008. Reprinted with permission from \[8\].

When the DNA tiles self-assemble on the initial structure (b), which includes only one site 1, a complex pattern made of triangles (c) will form \[9\]. This is called a Sierpinski triangle. Likewise, various different patterns are possible by adopting different "rules" of tiles. This process is the same as a one-dimensional cellular automaton. The lower sides of each tile correspond to an input, and the upper sides to an output. The right and left lower sides are designed to define the output from the right and left upper sides (the rules in this figure correspond to the XOR operation). The self-assembly of such DNA tiles, which can perform computation based on sticky ends and output various patterns, is called "algorithmic self-assembly".

Further, it is possible to have every connection differ in stick- end sequence from all the rest, so that the positional relationship between every two tiles (thus the final structure) is unequivocally defined. This can be implemented in single-stranded tile (SST) to make any two/three-dimensional structure, which is called a "DNA brick" (see column 1).

{aside}
**Column 1: DNA Bricks**

DNA bricks are two/three-dimensional structures made of a category of DNA tiles called single-stranded tile (SST) \[14\]. In most cases, a "motif" that defines the shape and "sticky ends" that define the connection are separately designed for a DNA tile. However, in SST, the double helix formed by a sticky end pair also specifies the shape of the tile. Each single strand DNA is composed of four domains (panel a), and each portion is connected to an adjacent SST, resulting in a structure made of multiple double helices bridged by multiple instances of half crossover branches (a structure with a hinge formed by a single DNA strand). This structure will allow more compact and simple sequence design than currently popular DX tiles, because each DNA strand itself serves as a tile, avoiding the need for a further internal structure to define the shape.

Thanks to such a structural advantage of SST, DNA bricks allow you to design any structure at a higher resolution (8 bp in the case of three-dimensional structures) than DNA origami. For example, imagine diversifying tiles in a given structure as much as possible. If a sticky end sequence in a given tile is designed to only fit a sticky end sequence in a particular different tile, every tile in the structure will be different from all the rest: i.e., the position of a given tile in the final structure is predetermined unequivocally. This strategy does not seem feasible for DX tiles and other tiles that require more than one DNA strand, because you will have to take sequence orthogonality into account for the internal structure of each tile. However, you can use this strategy in SST, where there is no internal shape and only sticky end sequence matters.

In other words, in DNA origami, it is the sequence of scaffold DNA that determines positional relationships. In DNA bricks, it is the sequence of domains inside each tile and their combination.

In order to assemble an actual structure, as shown in panel b, prepare a set of SST sequences that constitute a square, cubic, and other structures, which serves as a "canvas". Then select, mix, and anneal a subset that will form the desired structure. In this manner, you can obtain any shape \[15, 16\]. Similarly designed, mutually connectable unit structures have successfully provided a crystal structure \[17\].

**Column 2: "Closed" DNA Nanostructure**

In addition to DNA tiles, origami, and bricks, which are two/three-dimensional structures made of double helices, it is possible to obtain a DNA-based "closed structure".

\(a) A cubic structure \[10\] can be made by ligating a plurality of   circular DNA molecules of catenane topology.

# What Does Design of DNA Molecules Make Possible?

## 17. Structural DNA Nanotechnology: Overview

Structural DNA nanotechnology can produce various shapes using DNA molecules as material. This section outlines the molecular nature of DNA, basic structures that can be assembled from it, and three approaches currently used to assemble such structures.

### DNA Molecule

When asked what is DNA, most of you will answer, "genes." This is a correct answer in a biology class. However, have you ever thought of DNA simply as a "molecule" with a defined shape? Chemically, DNA is just a molecule made of a long string ("polymer") of "nucleotide" units, each of which consists of a sugar, base, and phosphate. DNA in this form is sometimes called "single-stranded DNA".

![](images/ch3fig1.png)

There are 4 kinds of bases: A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine). A base sequence is obtained by reading out bases in a single strand of DNA from one end to the other. DNA has a directionality, with one of its ends called the 5' terminus and the other the 3' terminus (based on the positions of two phosphates attached to a sugar), wherein its sequence is read from the 5’ terminus (as seen from the figure, the direction is often indicated by an arrow).

"DNA=genes" because organisms recognize DNA base sequences as information that guides a variety of biological activities including protein synthesis. Although DNA itself is just a molecule, organisms use it as a "data storage medium" to record/read out a set of information that matters to them.

As you know, the structure of DNA is a double helix. Two single strands of DNA that run in opposite directions stick to each other along their length to create this form, in which the bases also play an essential role. Each base has a property of "complementarity", so that only a specific partner can stick to it through hydrogen bonding, i.e. A to T and C to G. Two single DNA strands with mutually complementary sequences stick (hybridize) to each other along their length through hydrogen bonding between bases, forming this double helix structure of double strands. Strictly speaking, hydrophobic interactions between adjacent bases in the same strand are also involved in the double helix structure formation, but we will not discuss that here. In terms of engineering, you can expect that, even when a large number of DNA molecules with different sequences are present in an aqueous solution, any of them will only stick to a complementary DNA molecule to form a double strand, i.e. the double helix structure. See sections 41 to 44 for more details.

### Components of DNA Nanostructure

As discussed above, from an engineering point of view, you can regard DNA as a material with an interesting property: i.e., a string-shaped molecule that can stick to another one or more to spontaneously form a double helix, The process of matching one string to another is guided by internal base sequences. As described in section 45, today we can chemically synthesize a DNA molecule of any sequence. As a result, a pair of complementary sequences in a given site can be designed to be as dissimilar to those in other sites as possible (these are called orthonormal sequences), so that double helix-forming sites are appointed unequivocally. Because of our ability to create these structures, researchers initially investigated branched structures and sticky ends of DNA . These two features also serve as key components in the design of more complex DNA nanostructures, as discussed below.

#### Branched Structure

![](images/ch3fig2.png)

As an example, in the left Figure, the regions (a) and (c) in the first DNA have, by design, a sequence complementary to a region of the fourth DNA and to a region in the second DNA, respectively. Four different DNA molecules thus make this four-arm branched structure because only mutually complementary regions can hybridize to form a double helix. By dividing each DNA molecule into multiple regions and designing each region to stick to a specific region in the same or another DNA molecule, you can assemble not only a straight chain of double helix, but also more complex two-dimensional structures. At present, the most commonly used DNA nanostructure components include four-armed branches as described above (one without any single strand region b is sometimes called a crossover junction) and similarly designed three-armed branches.

#### Sticky Ends

![](images/ch3fig3.png)

Another important component of creating DNA nanostructures is sticky ends. Imagine two double strand DNA molecules (red and blue in the figure), each provided with a single strand overhang (a or b in the figure) in its terminus. If the base sequences a and b are mutually complementary, the two double helices are joined together through the hybridization of a and b. Such single stranded (i.e. a and b) regions are called "sticky ends". This technique is frequently used to join units into a large structure by the "glue"-like function that allows selective binding between their termini.

### Three Approaches

How should you apply these concepts, i.e. branches and sticky ends, to assemble a DNA structure? Currently there are three major approaches to the assembly of structures using DNA.

1\. Folding (e.g. DNA origami and tiles)

2\. Network formation (e.g. DNA hydrogel)

3\. Connector-like function (e.g. SNA)

These approaches can be distinguished by the different ways they direct a DNA molecule. In the folding approach, DNA double helices are bundled to form a desired nanostructure. Each double helix is regarded as a "tube", and, in principle, the structure is designed to form by joining the tubes. Techniques that rely primarily on folding include DNA origami, DNA tiles composed of a variety of DNA motifs, and recently reported DNA bricks. DNA hydrogel is a relatively new assembly approach, which considers a long double helix made of a plurality of joined DNA molecules as a "flexible macromolecule structure", not as a rigid tube. DNA hydrogel combines such structures to form a network, or gel, on the macro scale. In SNA, which is described in section 21, the selective binding ability intrinsic to DNA is more important than its structure, and DNA is used as "a glue with a length and a selective action". In this approach, DNA molecules are attached to gold nanoparticles to control the interaction between them and thus the crystallization of the nanoparticles.

These approaches will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

## 18. Two-Dimensional DNA Origami

DNA origami structures, now a prominent field of study in DNA nanotechnology and the most popular subject of BIOMOD projects, started with a DNA smiley face published in *Nature* magazine in 2006. That article outlined the principles underlying the design of their various elaborate structures. We explain a few principles here.

### Structural Basis of DNA Origami

Every DNA Origami structure is made of only two kinds of components, i.e., a long single-stranded DNA chain designated as "scaffold chain" and multiple short single-stranded DNA chains designated as "staple chains". The scaffold chain serves as a scaffold to assemble the structure. Usually the chain is M13mp18 ssDNA, a circular single-stranded DNA of 7,249 bases. This is the genome of the M13 bacteriophage which infects E. coli and can be prepared from the organism in a highly homogeneous manner. Any single strand DNA can be prepared using this bacteriophage, and it had been widely used as a DNA sequence analysis tool before modern DNA sequencers were developed. As a result, it is still available from biology reagent suppliers at a reasonable price. M13mp18 ssDNA is generally used in its circular form. It may also be used after linearization by enzymatic cleavage, which is, however, not recommended because the assembly of the origami structure will be incomplete when the cleavage does not occur quantitatively. Similarly, in order to assemble larger DNA origami structures, scaffold chains other than M13mp18 ssDNA (e.g., a fragment of the lambda phage genome) have been tested and reported, but seem to achieve less consistent assembly than M13mp18 ssDNA.

The single scaffold chain is folded like the weft thread in a fabric and formed into a desired planar structure by the action of the staple chains, which are generally 32 bases long. In order to assemble a DNA origami structure, DNA double helices have to be bundled like a wooden raft, similar to those in DX tiles. This can be achieved by introducing a crossover between the second helix and the third helix at a position that is 1.5 helical turns away from a crossover between the first helix and the second helix. This corresponds to 10.5 x 1.5 = 15.75 bases because the periodicity of a B-type DNA double helix is 10.5 base pairs. However, this is usually rounded to 16 bases because the decimal fractions in the number of bases are somewhat difficult to handle. That is, in a DNA origami structure, a staple chain bridges helices every 16 bases. Sixteen bases in the 32 bases correspond to this "region complementary to the second helix", while the staple chain also has to bind to the first and third helices. Thus, 8 bases complementary to the first helix and 8 bases complementary to the third helix are added to the aforementioned 16 bases, resulting in 32 bases total. As a result, in a DNA origami structure, the staple chains are bended in an S shape and/or a Z shape to bind to the scaffold chain. This might seem unimportant, but every helix has its handedness. Therefore, it is important to note that whether a staple chain is arranged in an S shape or a Z shape can make a large difference. That is, when a staple chain is arranged in an S shape, the termini of the staple chain will be the rear most objects in the design. When it is arranged in a Z shape, they will be the fore most objects in the design. This should be taken into consideration when the staple chain is to have an additional DNA chain or the like hanging from it. In order to fold the 7,249-base scaffold chain by means of 32-base staple chains, 7249/32 = 226.5 so 226.5 staple chains are required in the simplest calculation. Because the M13mp18 genome sequence can be regarded basically as random, two hundreds and several tens of DNA chains with mutually different sequences are required. Preparing their mixture might feel like a hard job, but the beauty of the resulting structure will reward you for all your trouble.

### Assembly and Observation of DNA Origami Structures

Once you have obtained the appropriate design and corresponding staple chains, a DNA origami structure can be assembled by a very simple procedure. By simply dissolving the scaffold chain and an excess amount (generally about 5 equivalents) of the staple chains in 1 x TAE/Mg^2+^ buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 2 mM EDTA, and 12.5 mM Mg^2+^ included), which is commonly used in DNA nanotechnology, and slowly cooling it from 90˚C to 25˚C (this is referred to as annealing), each staple chain will find their target regions complementary in the scaffold chain, folding the scaffold chain into the desired structure. You must always include a divalent cation (generally Mg^2+^) in the solution. Each DNA chain carries a high net negative charge due to its phosphodiester bonds, and thus cannot by itself form a dense structure of helices such as are required in DNA Origami, due to static repulsion. Thanks to the divalent cation, this repulsion can be neutralized and the helices bridged.

A divalent cation is also indispensable in observing a DNA origami structure. A two-dimensional, thin and planar DNA origami structure is usually observed under an atomic force microscope (AFM). When the DNA origami solution is added dropwise onto the highly planar structure of freshly cleaved mica, the negative charge on the mica surface and the negative charge of the DNA origami structure are bridged and neutralized by the divalent cation. As a result, the DNA origami structure beautifully adheres to the mica surface. This adhesion is so strong that even tapping by the AFM probe will not easily peel off the DNA origami structure. Thus, if your assembly has gone as planned, you will observe the desired Origami structure with a thickness of 2 nm (i.e., that of a DNA double helix).

Column: Flipbook Cartoon Made of DNA Origami

![](images/ch3fig6.png)

In BIOMOD 2013, Team Kansai from Kansai University reported a "DNA Origami flipbook cartoon", composed of a total of 10 AFM images, of "the Rabbit and the Turtle", and won the gold prize. Their idea of minimizing the number of the staples by connecting the ground, turtle, and rabbit through linkers was admired. The team also assembled a background layer of a roadside tree passing by via DNA origami, and got to the final in the Intercollegiate Science Competition sponsored by MEXT.

## 19. Three-Dimensional DNA Origami

"Origami" models well known to Japanese researchers include "crane" and other three-dimensional structures as well as two-dimensional structures such as "samurai helmet" and "yakko-san" (samurai's attendant). Several techniques for three-dimensional structure assembly have also been devised using nanoscale DNA origami.

In principle, the three-dimensional DNA origami structures reported so far can be divided into two classes.

### Three-Dimensional Hollow DNA Origami

The earliest three-dimensional DNA origami structures were hollow polyhedrons, each assembled from separate planar parts, which were reported by four groups almost at the same time in 2009 \[1-4\]. Two of them were box-shaped and designed to be intentionally "opened and closed" for their future use as nanocontainers (the other two were a regular tetrahedron and prism, respectively). In the structure made by Anderson _et al._, the faces are joined in a manner that allows only one face of the cube (about 40 nm square) to open/close like a lid \[1\]. The lid is kept closed by two different pairs of one DNA strand and another partially complementary strand. Addition of completely complementary DNA strands can selectively open the lid. The author's group calls the DNA strand pairs that keep the lid closed "locks" and the DNA strands that open the lid "keys". Afterward, Anderson _et al._ also made a smaller box-shaped structure that operates by the same mechanism \[5\].

The earliest "nanomechanical DNA origami device" independently made by the author's group is also a cubic, box-shaped DNA origami structure (about 40 nm square), but its operating mechanism somewhat differs from that of the above example \[2\]. In the first step to make this structure, two units, each composed of three mutually perpendicular faces, are joined through a hinge to form one "open structure". Then the open structure is turned into a box-shaped "closed structure" by the addition of a trigger DNA strand. Recently, it has been successfully used as a nanocarrier to selectively contain a single gold nanoparticle 10 nm in diameter \[6\]. Selective uptake of a gold nanoparticle into a similar lidded, box-shaped DNA origami structure has also been reported by Sugiyama _et al._ \[7\]. This system employs an artificial photoreactive base to assemble a DNA origami structure, which allows a light-triggered structural change.

Reprinted with permission from *Nature 2009.* (b) Regular tetrahedron DNA origami structure \[3\]. Reprinted with permission from *Nano Lett. 2009*. (c) DNA origami structure from our group \[2\].

Once the box-shaped structures as described above are opened, there is now way to keep them in the open state. Therefore, their free motion in an aqueous solution provides a driving force to open these structures. Firrao _et al._ reported an exemplary DNA origami structure that can be opened/closed by a more active driving force. They created a tubular DNA origami structure with a similar hatch that is driven by double strand DNA formation, and showed that it actually worked.

Hollow three-dimensional DNA origami structures can include curved surfaces, by virtue of the ability to bend DNA strands in a DNA origami \[8\]. For example, Yan _et al._ have successfully assembled flask- and sphere-shaped DNA origami structures.

![](images/ch3fig8.png)

A schematic based on \[8\].

Honeycomb Three-Dimensional DNA Origami

Another category of three-dimensional DNA origami structures is the honeycomb three-dimensional DNA origami \[9\].

![](images/ch3fig9.png)

Reprinted with permission from *Nature 2009.*

These structures will be more familiar to BIOMOD participants who use caDNAno. In actual situations, a hollow DNA origami structure in an aqueous solution will be subject to substantial fluctuation, because DNA itself is very flexible. On the other hand, such fluctutations will not occur in a honeycombed three-dimensional DNA origami, which is a solid three-dimensional structure formed by folding one origami sheet in a multilayer geometry. This technique can even introduce bends and twists into any three-dimensional structure, by carefully choosing the length of the DNA components and stacking differently sized layers \[10\]. Today, a plurality of such curved structures can be combined to make previously impossible complex three-dimensional nanostructures, such as a huge bird cage-like structure. Recently, a structure with an ion channel-like function that can pierce through a liposome has been created. \[11\].

## 20. DNA Tiles

Among DNA nanostructure assembly techniques, the "DNA tile" technique is used to make patterned two-dimensional structures and three-dimensional crystals. This section describes DNA tile basics, taking two-dimensional DNA motifs as an example. We also introduce the basic idea of a so-called "algorithmic self-assembly" technique.

DNA tiles = motifs + sticky ends

DNA tile is a representative assembly technique to assemble a nanostructure by DNA folding. It is like a jigsaw puzzle, which is assembled by joining small pieces one by one, at the molecular scale.

![](images/ch3fig10.png)

Adapted with permission from \[1\].

Here, a structural unit composed of more than one DNA double helix ("motif") corresponds to a jigsaw puzzle piece. In the case of a jigsaw puzzle, pieces have different shaped tabs and slots on their edges, which determine how the pieces are joined. In the case of DNA tiles, sticky ends play this role. DNA tiles can be joined together only when their sticky ends have mutually complementary sequences. In an actual jigsaw puzzle, you have to join pieces by hand. In DNA tiles, structures form spontaneously in an aqueous solution through Brownian motion and hybridization. This is called self-assembly. Specifically, slow cooling or "annealing" (see section 76) is employed to achieve a thermodynamically stable state (i.e. "a state that provides a long double helix"). During the cooling, each set of DNA molecules in the solution forms a tile, after which the tiles self-assemble to form a two/three-dimensional structure (i.e., in the case of DNA, puzzle pieces themselves are also spontaneously formed in the solution). Motifs that make up DNA tiles and an "algorithmic self-assembly" technique to form DNA tile-based patterns are outlined below.

DNA Motifs

A "repeat unit" structure made of a combination of branched DNA structures is called a DNA motif. The most representative motif used for DNA tiles is the double crossover (DX) molecule structure. In an aqueous solution that contain magnesium ions or the like to suppress the electrostatic repulsion between DNA molecules, a four-arm branched (crossover) structure can have a closed conformation as shown in the left or right in panel a. However, in this state, the conformation cannot be unequivocally specified because the branch still can move freely like a hinge. In panel b, two branches are provided between two double helices to fix their conformation, which is called a double crossover.

![](images/ch3fig11.png)

Adapted with permission from \[1\].

In double crossover (DX) tiles, the dimensions and sticky ends are carefully chosen so that double helices from adjacent tiles will be in phase, as shown in c \[2\]. These sticky ends can be interlocked to form a planar structure of two dimensionally joined tiles. This structure looks like a bundle of double helices that are arranged parallel to each other.

Similarly, triple crossover (TX) tiles have been reported, which are bundles of three double helices, (a) \[3\], n-point star with rotational symmetry (b) \[4\], cross-tile, which is a four-arm branch motif (c) \[5\], and single-stranded tile (SST), composed of a single strand which becomes double helical only when it is incorporated into the final assembly (d) \[6\].

![](images/ch3fig12.png)

Reprinted with permission from \[1\].

The authors have developed the T-motif \[7\], which is composed of T-branched structures instead of crossover branches. This can produce structures on mica or other substrates, serving as a platform to form a desired pattern of nanoparticles and proteins over a considerably large area.

### Algorithmic Self-Assembly

When DNA tiles have only one kind of sticky end, you will get a uniform two-dimensional planar structure made of identical tiles. What if more than one kind of sticky end is present: e.g., two sticky end pairs 1 and 0? When the right side of a tile A can be joined to the left side of a tile B through 1 and the right side of B to the left side of A through 0, a structure composed of alternate repetitions of A and B will form (panel. a).

![](images/ch3fig14.png)

Reprinted with permission from \[1\].

One such structure was actually made and showed a striped pattern of alternating protrusion-containing A tiles and protrusion-less B tiles (b) under atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Similarly, the use of more and more sets of sticky ends (and thus more and more different tiles) can provide more complex patterns. For example, assume four different tiles that each carry a distinct combination of sticky ends 1 and 0, as shown in panel a below.

![](images/ch3fig15.png)

Reprinted with permission from Natural Computing ©2008. Reprinted with permission from \[8\].

When the DNA tiles self-assemble on the initial structure (b), which includes only one site 1, a complex pattern made of triangles (c) will form \[9\]. This is called a Sierpinski triangle. Likewise, various different patterns are possible by adopting different "rules" of tiles. This process is the same as a one-dimensional cellular automaton. The lower sides of each tile correspond to an input, and the upper sides to an output. The right and left lower sides are designed to define the output from the right and left upper sides (the rules in this figure correspond to the XOR operation). The self-assembly of such DNA tiles, which can perform computation based on sticky ends and output various patterns, is called "algorithmic self-assembly".

Further, it is possible to have every connection differ in stick- end sequence from all the rest, so that the positional relationship between every two tiles (thus the final structure) is unequivocally defined. This can be implemented in single-stranded tile (SST) to make any two/three-dimensional structure, which is called a "DNA brick" (see column 1).

{aside}
**Column 1: DNA Bricks**

DNA bricks are two/three-dimensional structures made of a category of DNA tiles called single-stranded tile (SST) \[14\]. In most cases, a "motif" that defines the shape and "sticky ends" that define the connection are separately designed for a DNA tile. However, in SST, the double helix formed by a sticky end pair also specifies the shape of the tile. Each single strand DNA is composed of four domains (panel a), and each portion is connected to an adjacent SST, resulting in a structure made of multiple double helices bridged by multiple instances of half crossover branches (a structure with a hinge formed by a single DNA strand). This structure will allow more compact and simple sequence design than currently popular DX tiles, because each DNA strand itself serves as a tile, avoiding the need for a further internal structure to define the shape.

Thanks to such a structural advantage of SST, DNA bricks allow you to design any structure at a higher resolution (8 bp in the case of three-dimensional structures) than DNA origami. For example, imagine diversifying tiles in a given structure as much as possible. If a sticky end sequence in a given tile is designed to only fit a sticky end sequence in a particular different tile, every tile in the structure will be different from all the rest: i.e., the position of a given tile in the final structure is predetermined unequivocally. This strategy does not seem feasible for DX tiles and other tiles that require more than one DNA strand, because you will have to take sequence orthogonality into account for the internal structure of each tile. However, you can use this strategy in SST, where there is no internal shape and only sticky end sequence matters.

In other words, in DNA origami, it is the sequence of scaffold DNA that determines positional relationships. In DNA bricks, it is the sequence of domains inside each tile and their combination.

In order to assemble an actual structure, as shown in panel b, prepare a set of SST sequences that constitute a square, cubic, and other structures, which serves as a "canvas". Then select, mix, and anneal a subset that will form the desired structure. In this manner, you can obtain any shape \[15, 16\]. Similarly designed, mutually connectable unit structures have successfully provided a crystal structure \[17\].

## 21. DNA-Modified Particles (SNA)

Among three techniques involving DNA nanostructures, SNA (Spherical Nucleic Acids) forms a structure using gold nanoparticles or the like as a core and attaching DNA to it for selective binding. This section outlines its concept.

### SNA (Spherical Nucleic Acids)

Unlike "folding" and "hydrogel" approaches, which make structures solely from DNA, SNA uses colloidal particles as a structural core and attaches DNA molecules to them, which then interact to produce a crystal structure. This concept was devised by Mirkin _et al._ \[1\] and Alivisatos _et al._ \[2\] in 1996 (reported in the same issue of Nature). The generic name SNA was proposed by Mirkin, based on the appearance of the DNA molecules placed over the spherical particle surface. In the case of a DNA tile, its motif structure determines the stiffness. By analogy, in the case of an SNA, the spherical (or geometrically anisotropic) particle determines the stiffness. However, in an SNA, DNA molecules with sticky ends are attached to the entire particle surface. By virtue of interactions between this DNA population, the concept of "valence" or "bond" at the atomic level can be directly applied to the reactions between the colloidal particles. As a result of using the highly designable hybridization between DNA molecules in inter-particle interactions, programmable colloidal particles with "atom-like behavior" can be designed \[3\], which will allow for control of the crystal structure itself.

### Modification of Nanoparticles and Structure Assembly

At present, because of its relatively easy preparation, gold nanoparticles are usually chosen as a core. In a typical procedure, chemically synthesized DNA, modified with a thiol group, is reacted with and attached to the gold nanoparticle surface in a buffer that has an ion concentration adjusted to suppress the repulsion between DNA molecules. For example, the resulting particles can be connected via these DNA linkers to provide a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) or body-centered cubic (b.c.c.) crystal structure (a) \[5,6\]. Recently, a "Wulff polyhedron" monocrystal structure was also obtained on the micro-scale through annealing \[7,8\] (b). This was very impressive in that a nano-scale interaction of DNA produced a macroscopic structure that is known as equilibrium shape in the field of crystal growth.

## 22. DNA Hydrogels

DNA hydrogel is the newest among the three approaches in structural DNA nanotechnology. This section describes technique to make a network of combined DNA molecules, and resulting exemplary gel structures, methods to characterize individual DNA hydrogel products, and some applications.

### Introduction

Among DNA-based structure assembly techniques, DNA hydrogel seeks to make macro-scale (i.e. micro-to-centimeter order) structures by forming a network in a solution. This section outlines previously reported DNA hydrogels, and their manufacture, characterization, and applications.

Chemical and Physical Gels

In general, a gel is classified into one of two kinds depending on the crosslink mechanism of its network.

![](images/ch3fig20.png)

One class is a chemical gel. A chemical gel is formed by covalent crosslinking. As a result, as long as its component molecules are unbroken, the whole network will remain intact (will not melt). A well-known example of chemical gel solely made of DNA has a motif-based design as described above \[1\]. Specifically, sticky ends of X, Y, T, or other branched structures are joined by an enzymatic reaction using ligase. This allows a robust network of double helices to be produced.

![](images/ch3fig21.png)

Another class is the physical gel. A physical gel is formed by a non-covalent crosslink mechanism (e.g., hydrogen bond or physical entanglement). The earliest examples of physical gel prepared from chemically synthesized DNA include one designed by Liu _et al._ in a motif-based manner \[2\], which has been formed by connecting Y branches using a double strand linker, both ends of which are sticky ends. In another example, a gel has been obtained using a non-DNA macromolecule as the network backbone in combination with the specific connection property of DNA hybridization \[3\]. Recently, 3D printing was applied to such a physical DNA hydrogel to obtain desired two/three-dimensional shapes at the macro scale \[4\].

Another technique to produce a DNA physical gel depends on DNA polymerase enzyme \[5\] (DNA polymerase extends a DNA strand complementary to a template, with a primer being the starting point), which is summarized below. First, a circular template DNA is prepared, to which a primer DNA (primer 1) complementary to a portion of the template sequence is hybridized, and then DNA polymerase starts the extension reaction of primer 1. This polymerase has strong strand displacement activity, resulting in a long single strand DNA product that is composed of multiple repeats of the sequence complementary to the template. This process is called RCA (Rolling Circle Amplification). This first reaction is allowed to proceed for a sufficiently long time, and then primer 2 (which is complementary to a portion of the product of primer 1), and primer 3 (which has a sequence identical to primer ), are added to the solution. Primer 2 starts an extension reaction using the extension product of primer 1 as a template. Primer 3 hybridizes to the initial circular template DNA or the product of primer 2 to start another extension reaction. The resulting DNA molecules become highly entangled with each other forming a gel network.

![](images/ch3fig22.png)

### Characterization

Is the structure obtained as above truly a gel? In most cases, the answer to this question is determined by dynamic viscoelasticity analysis using a rheometer. In dynamic viscoelasticity analysis, a sinusoidal stress is applied to a given sample and the strain response is measured. Based on their phase difference and amplitude, the storage modulus G' (the elastic portion; the degree of solid-like behavior of the sample) and the loss modulus G" (the viscous portion; the degree of liquid-like behavior of the sample) are calculated. G' &gt; G" means that the sample is a gel.

![](images/ch3fig23.png)

### Applications

One of the most promising applications of DNA hydrogel is the incorporation of a gene-containing DNA such as a plasmid into a gel network to promote cell-free protein synthesis inside the gel \[6\]. This system has proved to be capable of synthesizing protein about 300 times more efficiently than a solution system. This might be due to the protection of the molecular structure of the gene by the DNA hydrogel, a higher concentration of the gene in the gel compared to a solution system, more efficient turnover of the enzymatic reactions (thus improved transcription efficiency), etc.

## 23. DNA Nanomachines and Nanorobots: Overview

DNA cannot only make a "shape", but also a "motion". How can we produce motion using DNA?

### Molecular Machines

A molecular machine is defined as "a molecule that goes through some directional movement in response to an input stimulus". In general, it has a plurality of states and repeats the transition between them.

An organism is made of innumerable, highly sophisticated molecular machines. A wide variety of protein-based molecular machines are at work in every cell. For example, molecular motors essential for bacterial flagellum rotation are driven by the proton concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Muscle contraction is the result of the sliding of actin and myosin protein filaments, which depends on the energy of ATP hydrolysis. As another example, F-type ATP synthase, which is responsible for ATP synthesis in most organisms, itself rotates to carry out the synthesis reaction. These natural biological molecular machines are highly efficient.

On the other hand, artificial molecular machines employ a catenane (multiple ring-shaped molecules mutually interlocked like a chain), a rotaxane (a dumbbell-shaped molecule threaded through a macrocycle, interlocked by the ends of the dumbbell), and the like that function as joints, bearings, and other movable molecular elements. These machines include molecular shuttles, molecular tweezers, and nanocars. A nanocar has four wheels made of fullerene, and each axle can endlessly rotate on a covalent carbon-carbon bond. A nanocar has been reported to be driven straight over a gold surface by thermal fluctuation \[1\].

These artificial molecular machines are remarkably large for synthetic organic macromolecules, but only capable of relatively primitive motions such as shuttling and rotary motions.

### DNA Nanomachines

DNA allows more complex motions to be achieved, and even for these motions to be controlled. Driving mechanisms for DNA nanomachines include the following.

- Driving Mechanisms for DNA Nanomachine:
- External
- Strand displacement (DNA input)\*
- B-Z transition (salt concentration change)
- Light-responsive base (light input)
- Autonomous
- Enzymatic reaction (DNAzyme, restriction enzyme)\*
- Strand displacement (with autonomous DNA input)\*

_\*sequence-specific (only driven by a particular sequence)._

In an externally driven system, a nanomachine moves only one step every time it receives a certain input signal provided externally. In an autonomous system, movement happens autonomously without such external signals (or it appropriately generates the required molecular signal).

The most common external driving mechanism is strand displacement (see section 42). In this case, different DNA single strands are added to the solution by pipetting, one at a time. Each DNA single strand added displaces a part of the DNA nanomachine structure, causing the nanomachine to change its shape (this constitutes one motion). A representative example is molecular tweezers (see section 24). One advantage of the strand displacement-based driving method is that you can choose the site of displacement. Other variations include walker (see section 25) and pliers (see section 26). At present, the most complex nanomachine driven by strand displacement is the nanofactory developed by Seeman's group (see section 26).

The B-Z transition driving method relies on the fact that a DNA molecule with the base sequence CGCGCG... flips from the right-handed B form to the left-handed Z form and vice versa, depending on surrounding ion concentration. You can change the ion concentration of the solution by repeatedly pipetting so that the machine repeats the flipping motion. Another nanomachine depends on a light-responsive artificial base such as azobenzene (see section 48). Because the azobenzene molecule changes its form upon light irradiation, UV irradiation can control the association/dissociation of an azobenzene-containing double stranded DNA. The B-Z transition and light-responsive base driving methods are not suitable for complex motions, because a single input causes all actuators to move at the same time.

There are relatively few examples of autonomous molecular machines. One example is the autonomous walker (see section 25). The walker achieves a walking motion by binding to an array of track DNA molecules provided on a two-dimensional DNA origami (see section 18), and then cleaving the bound track DNA by means of a DNAzyme sequence contained in each leg (see section 30). The walker does not require any external input because it autonomously repeats the cycle of taking one step and binding the next track DNA upon the cleavage of one track DNA.

### Slime Robot

Any of the molecular machines described above works as a single molecule in a solution, by changing its shape and/or binding state stepwise. A more elaborate system, the Molecular Robotics Project (see column 1) seeks to achieve a slime-like motion by enclosing a DNA computing circuit and a molecular actuator in a reactor such as a liposome (see section 89). The behavior of microtubules can be controlled by attaching a DNA tag to them, to which an autonomous DNA reaction system (see section 27) will be applied in the future \[2\].

## 24. DNA Tweezers

A DNA nanomachine can perform a mechanical task by changing its structure in a sequence-specific, reversible manner, in the absence of any change in the temperature and pH of the environment. The strand displacement reaction, which was created to drive DNA tweezers, is now commonly used to drive many DNA nanomachines and DNA logic gates.

DNA Nanomachines

How can we make and drive a machine of a nanometer size, which is far smaller than a micrometer? A DNA strand can hybridize to a complementary strand in a sequence-specific manner, to change from a random coil-like single strand state to a relatively rigid, rod-like double strand state (see section 40). This self-assembling property can produce two/three-dimensional nanostructures (see section 17). If such a DNA nanostructure can change its structure repetitively, it means that a nano-sized machine can be achieved.

For example, a change in the pH and ionic strength of the environment can cause structural change in a molecule. However, it will not be so easy to obtain a set of different molecules that will exhibit different structure changes in response to a given environmental change and combine them to perform a complex mechanical task. It is also difficult to have one environmental change control only one of the different molecular machines or drive all of them cooperatively. Is it possible to reversibly change a structure assembled by means of the sequence-specific hybridization of a DNA molecule?

Thermodynamically, the self-assembly of DNA into a nanostructure proceeds toward a more favorable state in terms of free energy. By appropriately arranging complementary sequences in the design, a variety of structures can form spontaneously upon just mixing DNA molecules. Theoretically, after a structure has been obtained, another DNA strand capable of binding to a DNA strand in the structure in an energetically more favorable state can be externally added to cause a structural change. However, for the structural change to be reversible, the base-paired strands have to dissociate again and form base pairs with another strand, which involves an unfavorable state in terms of free energy and will take an unimaginably long time. Thus, we used to think it was impossible to operate such a machine on a practical time scale. However, the "DNA tweezers" built by Yurke _et al._ \[1\] accomplished this.

### Operating Mechanism of DNA Tweezers

DNA tweezers are driven by the sequential addition of two DNA strands serving as a signal that directs the structural change and works as a fuel to create a simple structure made of three DNA strands. The tweezers-like structure, two rigid rods connected by a hinge, is assembled by the hybridization of one DNA strand (T~a~) and two other DNA strands (T~b~ and T~c~) each of which carries a sequence complementary to the 5' or 3' end of T~a~ (top left in the figure). The two rods each have a single strand overhang. When a DNA strand (F~c~) that is complementary to both overhangs is added, it hybridizes to the rods to turn the tweezers into a closed structure. The added DNA can be regarded as a "signal" to direct the structural change in a sequence-specific manner and a "fuel" to drive the structural change toward a favorable state in terms of free energy.

If the bound F~c~ strand is capable of being dissociated from the structure by means of another signal/fuel DNA strand, it means that a reversible mechanical task can be achieved. In the structure shown in the bottom of the figure, a single strand overhang in the closed structure, "toe-hold", is bound by a DNA strand (F~o~) that includes a sequence complementary to it. F~o~ also carries a sequence complementary to a sequence in the double strand formed between F~c~ and the tweezers, causing base pair displacement. Base pair displacement is a process with no substantial change in free energy, which proceeds in a random-walk manner. When all the base pairs in F~c~ have been displaced, the double strand structure formed between F~c~ and F~o~ is released as waste, and the DNA tweezers return to the original open structure. Such a "strand displacement reaction" is now employed as a driving mechanism in many DNA nanomachines and enzyme-free DNA logic gates.

### Performance Test of DNA Tweezers

Compared to a typical DNA origami structure of several thousand base pairs, DNA tweezers, composed of less than 100 base pairs, are so small that their structure cannot be observed even by AFM. Whether they are actually working is usually examined by observing changes in the fluorescence that reflects the motion of a large population of DNA tweezers in a bulk solution. To do this, the termini of the DNA strand T~a~ are modified with a fluorescent group and a quencher group, respectively (indicated by small balls in the figure). When the F~c~ strand is added and the DNA tweezers are closed, the fluorescent group and the quencher group come into proximity so that the fluorescence decreases, demonstrating the formation of the closed structure. If an increase in the fluorescence is observed when the F~o~ strand is added, it means that the DNA tweezers have opened again through the reverse motion. The force caused by the open/closed motion of DNA tweezers has been thermodynamically calculated at about 15 pN, which is comparable to that caused by the natural protein molecular motors kinesin and myosin.

### Recent Progress

DNA tweezers need the addition of a DNA solution to perform each open/close motion. When the reaction solution is a closed system, this step also results in dilution of DNA tweezers; i.e., repeated additions of the DNA solution causes a gradual decrease in operating efficiency. The accumulation of wastes may also induce unexpected interactions. Asanuma _et al._ have reported an azobenzene-based optical control of the hybridization that activates the open/close motion of DNA tweezers by UV light, without any addition of DNA \[2\].

Yan _et al._ made a larger, tweezers-like structure from DNA and attached an enzyme and its cofactor to its tips, to build a nanoreactor in which an enzymatic reaction was controlled by the open/close motion of the DNA tweezers \[3\]. When the DNA tweezers are closed and the dehydrogenase and NAD^+^ come into proximity, the enzymatic reaction is promoted by more than 5-fold compared to that in the open state, demonstrating the control of an enzymatic reaction by DNA tweezers. Expected future applications of this include more complex mechanical tasks and elaborate reaction control systems based on DNA tweezers.
